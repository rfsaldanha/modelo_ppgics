abstract = {This paper considers ways of thinking about causes and prevention that could guide epidemiology beyond the present era. Discontent with modem epidemiology, in the face of its substantial achievements, is taken as a sign that the guiding principles of the discipline warrant reconsideration. To begin this task, current practices are placed within an historical perspective, in a review of the dominant ideas of successive eras in epidemiology. Then the premises and constraints of the present era of chronic disease epidemiology, with its risk factor paradigm, are specified. Finally, elements of a causal paradigm for an emerging era are proposed. This paradigm encourages thinking about causes at multiple levels of organization and within the historical context of both societies and individuals. The proposed approach aims to preserve and build on the contributions of past eras, as well as the present one.},

abstract = {The digital world is generating data at a staggering and still increasing rate. While these “big data” have unlocked novel opportunities to understand public health, they hold still greater potential for research and practice. This review explores several key issues that have arisen around big data. First, we propose a taxonomy of sources of big data to clarify terminology and identify threads common across some subtypes of big data. Next, we consider common public health research and practice uses for big data, including surveillance, hypothesis-generating research, and causal inference, while exploring the role that machine learning may play in each use. We then consider the ethical implications of the big data revolution with particular emphasis on maintaining appropriate care for privacy in a world in which technology is rapidly changing social norms regarding the need for (and even the meaning of) privacy. Finally, we make suggestions regarding structuring teams and training to succeed in working with big data in research and practice.},

abstract = {Objective: To develop a probabilistic model for discovering and quantifying determinants of outbreak detection and to use the model to predict detection performance for new outbreaks. Materials and methods: We used an existing software platform to simulate waterborne disease outbreaks of varying duration and magnitude. The simulated data were overlaid on real data from visits to emergency department in Montreal for gastroenteritis. We analyzed the combined data using biosurveillance algorithms, varying their parameters over a wide range. We then applied structure and parameter learning algorithms to the resulting data set to build a Bayesian network model for predicting detection performance as a function of outbreak characteristics and surveillance system parameters. We evaluated the predictions of this model through 5-fold cross-validation. Results: The model predicted performance metrics of commonly used outbreak detection methods with an accuracy greater than 0.80. The model also quantified the influence of different outbreak characteristics and parameters of biosurveillance algorithms on detection performance in practically relevant surveillance scenarios. In addition to identifying characteristics expected a priori to have a strong influence on detection performance, such as the alerting threshold and the peak size of the outbreak, the model suggested an important role for other algorithm features, such as adjustment for weekly patterns. Conclusion: We developed a model that accurately predicts how characteristics of disease outbreaks and detection methods will influence on detection. This model can be used to compare the performance of detection methods under different surveillance scenarios, to gain insight into which characteristics of outbreaks and biosurveillance algorithms drive detection performance, and to guide the configuration of surveillance systems.},

@article{Albert-Green2014,
abstract = {In Canada, the Fire Weather Index (FWI) provides forest fire managers with an overall measure of fire danger. Specifically, the FWI is a numerical rating of the potential intensity of a forest fire based on its potential spread rate and the amount of vegetation available for combustion. In our analyses, we consider daily FWI time series, recorded over 42 fire seasons from a sample of fire-weather stations in Ontario, Canada. Graphical exploratory analyses of the data, including stalagmite plots (a new interactive, three-dimensional visualization tool), show that the FWI switches between epochs of nil and non-nil behaviour. This paper develops a framework for assessing sojourn times in these two phases. At some sites, the FWI process appears to begin each year as an approximate Markov process before gradually losing its Markovian character. However, a time-homogeneous discrete time Markov chain model is insufficient overall, because those sojourn times are not found to be geometrically distributed. Instead, the duration of epochs in each of these phases can be more accurately modelled using beta-geometric random variables which incorporate seasonality of phase-specific run length behaviour using local likelihood methods.},

abstract = {Cervical cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women worldwide, after breast cancer. A preponderance of evidence supports a causal link between human papillomavirus infection and cervical neoplasia. The presence of high-risk human papillomavirus genital subtypes increases the risk of malignant transformation. Widespread use of the Papanicolaou smear has dramatically reduced the incidence of cervical cancer in developed countries. Accurate and early recognition of abnormal cytologic changes prevents progression of the disease from preinvasive to invasive. Research is under way to determine if efforts to reduce the false-negative rate of the Papanicolaou smear should include rescreening programs and fluid-based technology. Once cervical cancer is diagnosed, clinical staging takes place. Early-stage tumors can be managed with cone biopsy or simple hysterectomy. Higher stage tumors can be treated surgically or with radiotherapy. Advanced metastatic disease may respond to radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy. Protein markers for detection of recurrence and vaccines for prevention of cervical cancer are under investigation.},

abstract = {Clinical data sharing between healthcare institutions, and between practitioners is often hindered by privacy protection requirements. This problem is critical in collaborative scenarios where data sharing is fundamental for establishing a workflow among parties. The anonymization of patient information burned in DICOM images requires elaborate processes somewhat more complex than simple de-identification of textual information. Usually, before sharing, there is a need for manual removal of specific areas containing sensitive information in the images. In this paper, we present a pipeline for ultrasound medical image de-identification, provided as a free anonymization REST service for medical image applications, and a Software-as-a-Service to streamline automatic de-identification of medical images, which is freely available for end-users. The proposed approach applies image processing functions and machine-learning models to bring about an automatic system to anonymize medical images. To perform character recognition, we evaluated several machine-learning models, being Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) selected as the best approach. For accessing the system quality, 500 processed images were manually inspected showing an anonymization rate of 89.2{\%}. The tool can be accessed at https://bioinformatics.ua.pt/dicom/anonymizer and it is available with the most recent version of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Safari. A Docker image containing the proposed service is also publicly available for the community.},

abstract = {Background Internet access and usage has changed how people seek and report health information. Meanwhile,infectious diseases continue to threaten humanity. The analysis of Big Data, or vast digital data, presents an opportunity to improve disease surveillance and epidemic intelligence. Epidemic intelligence contains two components: indicator based and event-based. A relatively new surveillance type has emerged called event-based Internet biosurveillance systems. These systems use information on events impacting health from Internet sources, such as social media or news aggregates. These systems circumvent the limitations of traditional reporting systems by being inexpensive, transparent, and flexible. Yet, innovations and the functionality of these systems can change rapidly. Aim To update the current state of knowledge on event-based Internet biosurveillance systems by identifying all systems, including current functionality, with hopes to aid decision makers with whether to incorporate new methods into comprehensive programmes of surveillance. Methods A systematic review was performed through PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, while also including grey literature and other publication types. Results 50 event-based Internet systems were identified, including an extraction of 15 attributes for each system, described in 99 articles. Each system uses different innovative technology and data sources to gather data, process, and disseminate data to detect infectious disease outbreaks. Conclusions The review emphasises the importance of using both formal and informal sources for timely and accurate infectious disease outbreak surveillance, cataloguing all event-based Internet biosurveillance systems. By doing so, future researchers will be able to use this review as a library for referencing systems, with hopes of learning, building, and expanding Internet-based surveillance systems. Event-based Internet biosurveillance should act as an extension of traditional systems, to be utilised as an additional, supplemental data source to have a more comprehensive estimate of disease burden.},

abstract = {Income is related to health in three ways: through the gross national product of countries, the income of individuals, and the income inequalities among rich nations and among geographic areas. A central question is the degree to which these associations reflect a causal association. If so, redistribution of income would improve health. This paper discusses two ways in which income could be causally related to health: through a direct effect on the material conditions necessary for biological survival, and through an effect on social participation and opportunity to control life circumstances. The fewer goods and services are provided publicly by the community, the more important individual income is for health. Under present U.S. circumstances, a policy of counteracting growing income inequalities through the tax and benefit system and of public provision appears justified.},

abstract = {The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus (Aedes), similar to other arboviruses, first identified in Uganda in 1947. Few human cases were reported until 2007, when a Zika outbreak occurred in Yap, Micronesia, even though ZIKV activity had been reported in Africa and in Asia through virological surveillance and entomological studies. French Polynesia has recorded a large outbreak since October 2013. A great number of cases and some with neurological and autoimmune complications have been reported in a context of concurrent circulation of dengue viruses. The clinical presentation is a "dengue-like syndrome". Until the epidemic in French Polynesia, no severe ZIKV disease had been described so far. The diagnosis is confirmed by viral genome detection by genomic amplification (RT- PCR) and viral isolation. These two large outbreaks occurred in a previously unaffected area in less than a decade. They should raise awareness as to the potential for ZIKV to spread especially since this emergent disease is not well known and that some questions remain on potential reservoirs and transmission modes as well as on clinical presentations and complications. ZIKV has the potential to spread to new areas where the Aedes mosquito vector is present and could be a risk for Southern Europe. Strategies for the prevention and control of ZIKV disease should include the use of insect repellent and mosquito vector eradication. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {The capabilities for uisualization, rapid data retrieval, and manipulation in geographic informution systems (GIS) have created the need for new techniques of exploratory data analysis that focus on the “spatial” aspects of the data. The identifcation of local patterns of spatial assocktion is an important concern in this respect. In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G: statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identifiy “outliers,” as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial eualuation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of confict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations},

abstract = {Adjuvant chemotherapy (CTX) should be individualized to make the potential survival benefit and avoid potential harm for cancer patients. Our goal was to establish the computational approach for making personalized estimates of the survival benefit from adjuvant CTX. We developed Sub-Network based Ran-dom Forest classifier for predicting Chemotherapy Benefit (SNRFCB) based gene expression dataset of lung cancer. SNRFCB approach was then validated to independent test cohort for identifying chemotherapy responder cohorts and chemotherapy non-responder cohorts. SNRFCB involved the pre-selection of genes sub-network signatures based on the mutations and on protein-protein interactions data as well as the application of random forest algorithm to gene expression datasets. Lung cancer patients receiving adjuvant CTX were significantly associated with prolonged overall survival in the chemotherapy responder group (P=0.008), but was not beneficial in the chemotherapy non-responder group (P=0.657). Lung cancer squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC) subtype patients treated with adjuvant CTX were significantly associated with prolonged overall survival of the chemotherapy responder cohorts (P=0.024), but was not beneficial for the chemotherapy non-responder cohorts P=0.383). SNRFCB improved prediction performance as compared to the machine learning method support vector machine (SVM). To test the general applicability of the predictive model, we further applied SNRFCB approach on human breast cancer datasets and also observed superior performance. SNRFCB could provide recurrent probability for individual patient and identify which patient may benefit from adjuvant CTX in clinical trial.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new social networking site, Cloudworks, which has been developed to enable discussion and sharing of learning and teaching ideas/designs and to promote reflective academic practice. The site aims to foster new forms of social and participatory practices (peer critiquing, sharing, user-generated content, aggregation, and personalisation) within an educational context. One of the key challenges in the development of the site has been to understand the user interactions and the changing patterns of user behaviour as it evolves. The paper explores the extent to which four frameworks that have been used in researching networked learning contexts can provide insights into the patterns of user behaviour that we see in Cloudworks. The paper considers this within the current debate about the new types of interactions, networking, and community being observed as users adapt to and appropriate new technologies.},

abstract = {Networks of relationships help determine the careers that people choose, the jobs they obtain, the products they buy, and how they vote. The many aspects of our lives that are governed by social networks make it critical to understand how they impact behavior, which network structures are likely to emerge in a society, and why we organize ourselves as we do. In Social and Economic Networks, Matthew Jackson offers a comprehensive introduction to social and economic networks, drawing on the latest findings in economics, sociology, computer science, physics, and mathematics. He provides empirical background on networks and the regularities that they exhibit, and discusses random graph-based models and strategic models of network formation. He helps readers to understand behavior in networked societies, with a detailed analysis of learning and diffusion in networks, decision making by individuals who are influenced by their social neighbors, game theory and markets on networks, and a host of related subjects. Jackson also describes the varied statistical and modeling techniques used to analyze social networks. Each chapter includes exercises to aid students in their analysis of how networks function. This book is an indispensable resource for students and researchers in economics, mathematics, physics, sociology, and business.},

abstract = {Temporal networks, i.e., networks in which the interactions among a set of elementary units change over time, can be modelled in terms of timevarying graphs, which are time-ordered sequences of graphs over a set of nodes. In such graphs, the concepts of node adjacency and reachability crucially depend on the exact temporal ordering of the links. Consequently, all the concepts and metrics proposed and used for the characterisation of static complex networks have to be redefined or appropriately extended to time-varying graphs, in order to take into account the effects of time ordering on causality. In this chapter we discuss how to represent temporal networks and we review the definitions of walks, paths, connectedness and connected components valid for graphs in which the links fluctuate over time.We then focus on temporal node-node distance, and we discuss how to characterise link persistence and the temporal small-world behaviour in this class of networks. Finally, we discuss the extension of classic centrality measures, including closeness, betweenness and spectral centrality, to the case of time-varying graphs, and we review the work on temporal motifs analysis and the definition of modularity for temporal graphs. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

Worldwide, it is estimated that more than one million women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year, and more than 410,000 will die from the disease. In low- and middle-income countries (LMCs), the infrastructure and resources for routine screening mammography are often unavailable. In such lower resource settings, breast cancers are commonly diagnosed at late stages, and women may receive inadequate treatment, pain relief, or palliative care. There have been an increasing number of global health initiatives to address breast cancer including efforts by Susan G. Komen for the Cure
                        ??, the Breast Health Global Initiative (BHGI), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and ongoing work by leading oncology societies in different parts of the world. To support such initiatives, and to provide a scientific evidence base for health policy and public health decision making, there is a need for further health services research and program evaluations. Cancer registries can be invaluable in ascertaining the magnitude of cancer disease burden and its distribution in these countries. Additional data are needed for various geographic areas to assess resources required, cost-effectiveness, and humane approaches for preventing or controlling breast cancer in low resource settings in developing countries.},

abstract = {Violence is a public health problem that affects people of all ages. In 2007, violence was one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States for people from birth to age 64 years. Violence takes many forms, such as child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, sexual violence, self-directed violence, and youth violence. Violence may be best understood and prevented through a public health approach. A focus is placed on preventing violence before it occurs (primary prevention), employing a scientific approach to understand the problem and what action can be taken to prevent it, taking a population perspective that places an emphasis on broad-based changes in communities and society that benefit the largest number of people, and working across sectors (eg, health, justice, education) and integrating knowledge from multiple disciplines (eg, epidemiology, psychology, sociology, medicine). In this article, the authors review the incidence and burden of different forms of violence and the factors that place people at risk for, or protect people from, experiencing violence either as a victim or as a perpetrator. The authors also review strategies based on the best available evidence that may be implemented to prevent violence from occurring, highlighting violence prevention tools for health practitioners. By understanding the burden of violence, the factors that place people at risk for and protect people from experiencing violence, and strategies that can prevent and interrupt violence, health practitioners can play a more active role in enhancing the health and safety of their patients.},

The models were developed and tested on 20 participants (n = 10 males, n = 10 females, mean age = 24.1, mean body mass index = 23.9), who wore an ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer on their dominant wrist and an ActiGraph GT3X on the hip while performing a variety of scripted activities. Energy expenditure was concurrently measured by a portable indirect calorimetry system. Those calibration data were then used to develop and assess both machine-learning and simpler models with fewer unknown parameters (linear regression and decision trees) to estimate metabolic equivalent scores (METs) and to classify activity intensity, sedentary time, and locomotion time. The wrist models, applied to 15-s windows, estimated METs [random forest: root mean squared error (rSME) = 1.21 METs, hip: rMSE = 1.67 METs] and activity intensity (random forest: 75{\%} correct, hip: 60{\%} correct) better than a previously developed model that used counts per minute measured at the hip. In a separate set of comparisons, the simpler decision trees classified activity intensity (random forest: 75{\%} correct, tree: 74{\%} correct), sedentary time (random forest: 96{\%} correct, decision tree: 97{\%} correct), and locomotion time (random forest: 99{\%} correct, decision tree: 96{\%} correct) nearly as well or better than the machine-learning approaches. Preliminary investigation of the models' performance on two free-living people suggests that they may work well outside of controlled conditions.},

abstract = {In nowadays, there are many various diseases, whose diagnosis is very hardly. Lung cancer is one of this type diseases. It begins in the lungs and spreads to other organs of human body. In this paper, an expert diagnostic system based on General Discriminant Analysis (GDA) and Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) Classifier for diagnosis of lung cancer. This expert diagnosis system is called as GDA-LS-SVM in rest of this paper. The GDA-LS-SVM expert diagnosis system has two stages. These are 1. Feature extraction and feature reduction stage and 2. Classification stage. In feature extraction and feature reduction stage, lung cancer dataset is obtained and dimension of this lung cancer dataset, which has 57 features, is reduced to eight features using Generalized Discriminant Analysis (GDA) method. Then, in classification stage, these reduced features are given to Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifier. The lung cancer dataset used in this study was taken from the UCI machine learning database. The classification accuracy of this GDA-LS-SVM expert system was obtained about 96.875{\%} from results of these experimental studies.},

abstract = {The central theme of this article is the character and causes of long-term changes in the personal distribution of income in the U.S. Various aspects in this field of study has been plagued by looseness in definitions, unusual scarcity of data, and pressures of strongly held opinions. While it is not possible to completely avoid the resulting difficulties, it may help to specify the characteristics of the size-of-income distributions. Five specifications may be listed. First, units for which incomes are recorded and grouped should be family-expenditure units, properly adjusted for the number of persons in each. Second, the distribution should be complete in the sense that, it covers all units in a country rather than a segment either at the upper or lower tail. Third, if possible those units should be segregated whose main income earners are either still in the learning or already in the retired stages of their life cycle. Fourth, income should be defined for national income in the U.S. Fifth, these units should be grouped by secular levels of income, free of cyclical and other transient disturbances.},

abstract = {Statistical modeling is a powerful tool for developing and testing theories by way of causal explanation, prediction, and descrip-tion. In many disciplines there is near-exclusive use of statistical mod-eling for causal explanation and the assumption that models with high explanatory power are inherently of high predictive power. Conflation between explanation and prediction is common, yet the distinction must be understood for progressing scientific knowledge. While this distinction has been recognized in the philosophy of science, the statis-tical literature lacks a thorough discussion of the many differences that arise in the process of modeling for an explanatory versus a predictive goal. The purpose of this article is to clarify the distinction between explanatory and predictive modeling, to discuss its sources, and to re-veal the practical implications of the distinction to each step in the modeling process.},

abstract = {Part I of this paper traced the evolution of modern epidemiology in terms of three eras, each with its dominant paradigm, culminating in the present era of chronic disease epidemiology with its paradigm, the black box. This paper sees the close of the present era and foresees a new era of eco-epidemiology in which the deployment of a different paradigm will be crucial. Here a paradigm is advocated for the emergent era. Encompassing many levels of organization--molecular and societal as well as individual--this paradigm, termed Chinese boxes, aims to integrate more than a single level in design, analysis, and interpretation. Such a paradigm could sustain and refine a public health-oriented epidemiology. But preventing a decline of creative epidemiology in this new era will require more than a cogent scientific paradigm. Attention will have to be paid to the social processes that foster a cohesive and humane discipline.},

To investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of H1N1 spread, space-time K-function, implemented on the programme R, was applied. Four geographic regions were delineated in the exploration, but only in two of these, namely, Hong Kong Island and North, were statistically significant results obtained. On Hong Kong Island, clustering was detected from an intercase distance of 5km and intercase time of 12weeks onwards, which reflect continuous spread of H1N1 over the whole region without local outbreaks. In North, however, clustering in short intercase time periods suggested the occurence of local outbreaks. In conclusion, though Hong Kong is only a small city in size, the clustering patterns of H1N1 in urban (Hong Kong Island) and rural (North) regions had varied greatly. {\textcopyright} 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is limited information on influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) seasonal patterns in tropical areas, although there is renewed interest in understanding the seasonal drivers of respiratory viruses. METHODS: We review geographic variations in seasonality of laboratory-confirmed influenza and RSV epidemics in 137 global locations based on literature review and electronic sources. We assessed peak timing and epidemic duration and explored their association with geography and study settings. We fitted time series model to weekly national data available from the WHO influenza surveillance system (FluNet) to further characterize seasonal parameters. RESULTS: Influenza and RSV activity consistently peaked during winter months in temperate locales, while there was greater diversity in the tropics. Several temperate locations experienced semi-annual influenza activity with peaks occurring in winter and summer. Semi-annual activity was relatively common in tropical areas of Southeast Asia for both viruses. Biennial cycles of RSV activity were identified in Northern Europe. Both viruses exhibited weak latitudinal gradients in the timing of epidemics by hemisphere, with peak timing occurring later in the calendar year with increasing latitude (P{\textless}0.03). Time series model applied to influenza data from 85 countries confirmed the presence of latitudinal gradients in timing, duration, seasonal amplitude, and between-year variability of epidemics. Overall, 80{\%} of tropical locations experienced distinct RSV seasons lasting 6 months or less, while the percentage was 50{\%} for influenza. CONCLUSION: Our review combining literature and electronic data sources suggests that a large fraction of tropical locations experience focused seasons of respiratory virus activity in individual years. Information on seasonal patterns remains limited in large undersampled regions, included Africa and Central America. Future studies should attempt to link the observed latitudinal gradients in seasonality of viral epidemics with climatic and population factors, and explore regional differences in disease transmission dynamics and attack rates.},

abstract = {Dengue fever is one of the most widespread vector-borne diseases and has caused more than 50. million infections annually over the world. For the purposes of disease prevention and climate change health impact assessment, it is crucial to understand the weather-disease associations for dengue fever. This study investigated the nonlinear delayed impact of meteorological conditions on the spatiotemporal variations of dengue fever in southern Taiwan during 1998-2011. We present a novel integration of a distributed lag nonlinear model and Markov random fields to assess the nonlinear lagged effects of weather variables on temporal dynamics of dengue fever and to account for the geographical heterogeneity. This study identified the most significant meteorological measures to dengue fever variations, i.e., weekly minimum temperature, and the weekly maximum 24-hour rainfall, by obtaining the relative risk (RR) with respect to disease counts and a continuous 20-week lagged time. Results show that RR increased as minimum temperature increased, especially for the lagged period 5-18. weeks, and also suggest that the time to high disease risks can be decreased. Once the occurrence of maximum 24-hour rainfall is {\textgreater}. 50. mm, an associated increased RR lasted for up to 15. weeks. A temporary one-month decrease in the RR of dengue fever is noted following the extreme rain. In addition, the elevated incidence risk is identified in highly populated areas. Our results highlight the high nonlinearity of temporal lagged effects and magnitudes of temperature and rainfall on dengue fever epidemics. The results can be a practical reference for the early warning of dengue fever. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The question of the environmental or social costs of urban form is increasingly attracting attention in spatial policy, but scientific debate in this field is often marred by prejudices and abstract visions; empirical analyses are very rare. The present study aims at establishing, in the metropolitan area of Milan, whether different patterns of urban expansion could be associated with specific environmental costs—in particular, for land consumption and mobility generation. Different typologies of urban expansion were defined, and an impact index weighting differently journey-to-work trips with reference to mode and time length was built at the municipality level. The statistical analysis confirmed the expected “wasteful” character of sprawling development patterns in terms of land consumption, though suggesting that recent urban development is becoming relatively ‘virtuous' with respect to the past. With reference to the mobility generated, higher environmental impacts were proved to be associated with low densities, sprawling development, more recent urbanisation processes and residential specialisation of the single municipalities. Public transport seems to be strongly influenced, both in terms of efficiency and competitiveness, by the structural organisation of an urban area: the more dispersed and less structured the development, the lower its level of efficiency and competitiveness and consequently its share of the mobility market. On the contrary, trip times for private transport appear to be correlated not so much to urban dimension or density as to the presence of recent housing development, indicating the emergence of new models of lifestyle and mobility which are very different from those of the past.},

District-level data were assembled for a large number of potential explanatory variables relating to population numbers and characteristics, traffic exposure, road length, curvature and junction density, land use, elevation and hilliness, and climate. Multilevel negative binomial regression models were used to identify combinations of risk factors that predicted variations in mortality and morbidity. Statistically significant explanatory variables were the expected number of casualties derived from the size and age structure of the resident population, road length and traffic counts in the district, the percentage of roads classed as minor, average cars per capita, material deprivation, the percentage of roads through urban areas and the average curvature of roads. This study demonstrates that a geographical approach to road traffic crash analysis can identify contextual associations that conventional studies of individual road sections would miss.},

abstract = {Background: Early indication of an emerging malaria epidemic can provide an opportunity for proactive inter-ventions. Challenges to the identification of nascent malaria epidemics include obtaining recent epidemiological surveillance data, spatially and temporally harmonizing this information with timely data on environmental precur-sors, applying models for early detection and early warning, and communicating results to public health officials. Automated web-based informatics systems can provide a solution to these problems, but their implementation in real-world settings has been limited. Methods: The Epidemic Prognosis Incorporating Disease and Environmental Monitoring for Integrated Assessment (EPIDEMIA) computer system was designed and implemented to integrate disease surveillance with environmental monitoring in support of operational malaria forecasting in the Amhara region of Ethiopia. A co-design workshop was held with computer scientists, epidemiological modelers, and public health partners to develop an initial list of system requirements. Subsequent updates to the system were based on feedback obtained from system evaluation workshops and assessments conducted by a steering committee of users in the public health sector. Results: The system integrated epidemiological data uploaded weekly by the Amhara Regional Health Bureau with remotely-sensed environmental data freely available from online archives. Environmental data were acquired and processed automatically by the EASTWeb software program. Additional software was developed to implement a public health interface for data upload and download, harmonize the epidemiological and environmental data into a unified database, automatically update time series forecasting models, and generate formatted reports. Reporting features included district-level control charts and maps summarizing epidemiological indicators of emerging malaria outbreaks, environmental risk factors, and forecasts of future malaria risk. Conclusions: Successful implementation and use of EPIDEMIA is an important step forward in the use of epide-miological and environmental informatics systems for malaria surveillance. Developing software to automate the workflow steps while remaining robust to continual changes in the input data streams was a key technical challenge. Continual stakeholder involvement throughout design, implementation, and operation has created a strong enabling environment that will facilitate the ongoing development, application, and testing of the system.},

abstract = {are the provinces with the highest reported cases of AWD. The most affected age group was children under five who were 7-9 times more likely to have AWD than the rest of the population (P{\textless}0.001); in under-fives, males are more likely to be brought to healthcare facilities for AWD than females (P{\textless}0.001). Finally, in children under-five, we detected rotavirus in 48{\%} of the stool spec-imen tested at the sentinel sites. Conclusion: The increased AWD incidence may reflect a true increase in the burden of AWD in the country or an improvement in the sensitivity of the system given LAOEWARN was only introduced in 2008. We recommend integrating hygiene and sanitation health education into nursery school and primary school and exploring risk factors for AWD during dry seasons in order to plan control and prevention strategies. Background: The One Health approach suggests that humans, animals, and the environment are closely tied together. Human interaction with wildlife and the environment contributes to increased risk for human, plant, and animal infectious disease out-breaks. Despite the movement towards One Health, the software currently available to manage, analyze, and communicate the vast amount of One Health data is grossly inadequate. One Health data are continually growing in size and complexity, and new technolo-gies must be developed to address the magnitude of the problem. Open access and open source software are needed to address these complex One Health problems, and to improve data accessibility, interoperability, and information communication. Methods {\&} Materials: Mantle will handle tabular data, and other widely used spatial data formats. It will visualize and explore data in useful ways, and allow data to be downloaded as the origi-nally uploaded file or in a customizable format for use in analytical software. Mantle will store metadata—information about a dataset and its contents—using development standards for linked data (e.g., JSON-LD and WCSV, part of the overarching Resource Descrip-tion Framework). Tapping into the emerging semantic web enables richer interactions with datasets, streamlining many common data tasks. Results: Policymakers and decision makers will be able to view real-time visualizations of Mantle data feeds in dashboards. Researchers will be able to upload datasets representing the output of models built in other analytical software, which can be shared with policymakers, who can also view and interact with the output of custom-built modeling modules to view timely and meaningful summaries of public health data feeds. Potential use cases for the general public include browsing day-to-day textual and syndromic surveillance information, viewing the predictions of a one-time study, and monitoring the latest calculated epidemic curve in an outbreak or ongoing epidemic. Conclusion: Mantle will facilitate crosscutting collaborations between disciplines and institutions. Users will be able to cre-ate, manage, and join organizations and groups. Groups of users will access and collaborate on collections of datasets, grouped manually or by specified properties. For instance, users interested in Ranavirus can view and contribute to the Global Ranavirus Reporting System, a collaborative effort by scientists worldwide to aggregate observed cases of Ranavirus across species and locations (a Mantle prototype).},

abstract = {The era of Big Data has begun. Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathemati-cians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other scholars are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of ana-lyzing genetic sequences, social media interactions, health records, phone logs, govern-ment records, and other digital traces left by people. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data ana-lytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we study human communi-cation and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what 'research' means? Given the rise of Big Data as a socio-technical phenomenon, we argue that it is necessary to critically interrogate its assumptions and biases. In this article, we offer six provocations to spark conversations about the issues of Big Data: a cultural, techno-logical, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology, analysis, and mythology that provokes extensive utopian and dystopian rhetoric. Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral . . . technology's inter-action with the social ecology is such that technical developments frequently have environmental, social, and human consequences that go far beyond the immediate purposes of the technical devices and practices themselves.},

abstract = {The final report of the World Health Organization Commission on the Social Determinants of Health (CSDH), published in 2008, affirmed that social injustice was killing on a grand scale, with a toxic combination of 'poor social policies and programmes, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics' being responsible for producing and reinforcing health inequalities. It provided a comprehensive evidence-based discussion of pervasive inequalities of health in many countries, demonstrating the presence of a social gradient in health outcomes associated with the unfair distribution of the social determinants of health. The social determinants of health include the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age, and the fundamental drivers of these conditions: the distribution of power; money; and resources. Following publication of the CSDH report and recommendations for action, the UK Government commissioned a Strategic Review of Health Inequalities in England. This article provides an overview and reflection on the findings from the CSDH and the Strategic Review of Health Inequalities in England, reviewing the case for putting fairness at the heart of all policy making. In the process, it highlights the need for action on the social determinants of health in order to address health inequalities and the social gradient in health outcomes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To compare health research priority-setting methods and characteristics among countries in Latin America and the Caribbean during 2002 - 2012. METHODS This was a systematic review that identified national health research policies and priority agendas through a search of ministry and government databases related to health care institutions. PubMed, LILACS, the Health Research Web, and others were searched for the period from January 2002 - February 2012. The study excluded research organized by governmental institutions and specific national strategies on particular disease areas. Priority-setting methods were compared to the "nine common themes for good practice in health research priorities." National health research priorities were compared to those of the World Health Organization's Millennium Development Goals (MDG). RESULTS Of the 18 Latin American countries assessed, 13 had documents that established national health research priorities; plus the Caribbean Health Research Council had a research agenda for its 19 constituents. These 14 total reports varied widely in terms of objectives, content, dissemination, and implementation; most provided a list of strategic areas, suggestions, and/or sub-priorities for each country; however, few proposed specific research topics and questions. CONCLUSIONS Future reports could be improved by including more details on the comprehensive approach employed to identify priorities, on the information gathering process, and on practices to be undertaken after priorities are set. There is a need for improving the quality of the methodologies utilized and coordinating Regional efforts as countries strive to meet the MDG.},

abstract = {Objectives To review the extent of health disparities in gynecologic cancer care and outcomes and to propose recommendations to help counteract the disparities. Methods We searched the electronic databases PubMed and the Cochrane Library. We included studies demonstrating quantifiable differences by race and ethnicity in the incidence, treatment, and survival of gynecologic cancers in the United States (US). Most studies relied on retrospective data. We focused on differences between Black and White women, because of the limited number of studies on non-Black women. Results White women have a higher incidence of ovarian cancer compared to Black women. However, the all-cause ovarian cancer mortality in Black women is 1.3 times higher than that of White women. Endometrial and cervical cancer mortality in Black women is twice that of White women. The etiology of these disparities is multifaceted. However, much of the evidence suggests that equal care leads to equal outcomes for Black women diagnosed with gynecologic cancers. Underlying molecular factors may play an additional role in aggressive tumor biology and endometrial cancer disparities. Conclusion Gynecologic cancer disparities exist between Black and White women. The literature is limited by the lack of large prospective trials and adequate numbers of non-Black racial and ethnic groups. We conclude with recommendations for continued research and a multifaceted approach to eliminate gynecologic cancer disparities. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The fifth Millennium Development Goal (MDG 5) established the goal of a 75{\%} reduction in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR; number of maternal deaths per 100 000 livebirths) between 1990 and 2015. We aimed to measure levels and track trends in maternal mortality, the key causes contributing to maternal death, and timing of maternal death with respect to delivery.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to analyse a database of data for 7065 site-years and estimate the number of maternal deaths from all causes in 188 countries between 1990 and 2013. We estimated the number of pregnancy-related deaths caused by HIV on the basis of a systematic review of the relative risk of dying during pregnancy for HIV-positive women compared with HIV-negative women. We also estimated the fraction of these deaths aggravated by pregnancy on the basis of a systematic review. To estimate the numbers of maternal deaths due to nine different causes, we identified 61 sources from a systematic review and 943 site-years of vital registration data. We also did a systematic review of reports about the timing of maternal death, identifying 142 sources to use in our analysis. We developed estimates for each country for 1990-2013 using Bayesian meta-regression. We estimated 95{\%} uncertainty intervals (UIs) for all values.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFINDINGS: 292 982 (95{\%} UI 261 017-327 792) maternal deaths occurred in 2013, compared with 376 034 (343 483-407 574) in 1990. The global annual rate of change in the MMR was -0{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} (-1{\textperiodcentered}1 to 0{\textperiodcentered}6) from 1990 to 2003, and -2{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} (-3{\textperiodcentered}9 to -1{\textperiodcentered}5) from 2003 to 2013, with evidence of continued acceleration. MMRs reduced consistently in south, east, and southeast Asia between 1990 and 2013, but maternal deaths increased in much of sub-Saharan Africa during the 1990s. 2070 (1290-2866) maternal deaths were related to HIV in 2013, 0{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (0{\textperiodcentered}2-0{\textperiodcentered}6) of the global total. MMR was highest in the oldest age groups in both 1990 and 2013. In 2013, most deaths occurred intrapartum or postpartum. Causes varied by region and between 1990 and 2013. We recorded substantial variation in the MMR by country in 2013, from 956{\textperiodcentered}8 (685{\textperiodcentered}1-1262{\textperiodcentered}8) in South Sudan to 2{\textperiodcentered}4 (1{\textperiodcentered}6-3{\textperiodcentered}6) in Iceland.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERPRETATION: Global rates of change suggest that only 16 countries will achieve the MDG 5 target by 2015. Accelerated reductions since the Millennium Declaration in 2000 coincide with increased development assistance for maternal, newborn, and child health. Setting of targets and associated interventions for after 2015 will need careful consideration of regions that are making slow progress, such as west and central Africa.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFUNDING: Bill {\&} Melinda Gates Foundation.},

abstract = {Resistance to artemisinin casts a shadow on the fight against malaria. The importance of illegal gold miners and of malaria in isolated regions of French Guiana constitutes a threat that endangers the fight against malaria in the Amazon. The hurdles of French laws and the remoteness of the territory from France make it impossible for the system to adapt to the problem of total inaccessibility of an important part of the malaria problem. Transmission is high in these areas and gold miners self-medicate with erratic regimens of artemisinin combinations, thus creating perfect conditions for the emergence of resistance. What needs to be done is being done, but within the limits of national law, with some results. However, facing the same difficult problem, Suriname shows more flexibility and is doing much better than French Guiana despite having lower resources. Local authorities in French Guiana cannot overrule the laws that block appropriate malaria care from reaching a third of malaria-exposed persons. Thus the health authorities in France should take immediate calibrated legislative and financial measures to avoid a predictable disaster. Background},

abstract = {Purpose: Early detection of infectious disease outbreaks is crucial to protecting the public health of a society. Online news articles provide timely information on disease outbreaks worldwide. In this study, we investigated automated detection of articles relevant to disease outbreaks using machine learning classifiers. In a real-life setting, it is expensive to prepare a training data set for classifiers, which usually consists of manually labeled relevant and irrelevant articles. To mitigate this challenge, we examined the use of randomly sampled unlabeled articles as well as labeled relevant articles. Methods: Na??ve Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were trained on 149 relevant and 149 or more randomly sampled unlabeled articles. Diverse classifiers were trained by varying the number of sampled unlabeled articles and also the number of word features. The trained classifiers were applied to 15 thousand articles published over 15 days. Top-ranked articles from each classifier were pooled and the resulting set of 1337 articles was reviewed by an expert analyst to evaluate the classifiers. Results: Daily averages of areas under ROC curves (AUCs) over the 15-day evaluation period were 0.841 and 0.836, respectively, for the na??ve Bayes and SVM classifier. We referenced a database of disease outbreak reports to confirm that this evaluation data set resulted from the pooling method indeed covered incidents recorded in the database during the evaluation period. Conclusions: The proposed text classification framework utilizing randomly sampled unlabeled articles can facilitate a cost-effective approach to training machine learning classifiers in a real-life Internet-based biosurveillance project. We plan to examine this framework further using larger data sets and using articles in non-English languages. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Many data stories in journalism do not have a story arc, but rather present facts without much structure. This mirrors the popular inverted pyramid style of writing that presents the most important information up front, to be followed by evidence. We have found a subset of stories that follow a more structured approach, however. These stories begin with a claim or question, but do not immediately present that as the conclusion. Instead, they then present pieces of evidence that are only tied together, and back to the initial claim, at the end. In this paper, we formalize and discuss this structure, and present a few examples. We believe that this is a viable and practical model for data stories more generally, and certainly a stronger arc than most existing stories today.},

Descriptive statistics and regression analysis of data for cases of pandemic A(H1N1) infection and hospitalization in the province of Manitoba, Canada, were conducted to estimate the odds of hospitalization and delay in time-to-hospitalization for on-reserve and off-reserve FN populations, while considering their geographical proximity to urban centers. We found that on-reserve FN individuals experienced a longer delay between infection and hospitalization compared to off-reserve FN individuals (p{\textless}0.001). The average fraction of FN cases that experienced a delay longer than 4 days for hospitalization was 20{\%} higher for on-reserve compared to off-reserve residence. The odds of hospitalization were twice as high for FN people living on-reserve as compared to off-reserve (odds ratio=2.34; 95{\%} CI: 1.16-4.73). Given the independent effect of on-reserve residency, higher disease burden among FN people cannot be attributed entirely to limited healthcare access due to remoteness from urban centers.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION
The comparative analysis of macroscopic trends in road safety has been a popular research topic. The objective of this research is to propose a simple and, at the same time, reliable multiple regime model framework for international road safety comparisons, allowing for the identification of slope changes of personal risk curves and respective breakpoints. 

METHOD
The trends of road traffic fatalities in several EU countries have been examined through the temporal evolution of elementary socioeconomic indicators, namely motorized vehicle fleet and population, at the country level. 

RESULTS
Piece-wise linear regression models have been fitted, using a methodology that allows the simultaneous estimation of all slopes and breakpoints. The number and location of breakpoints, as well as the slope of the connecting trends, vary among countries, thus indicating different road safety evolution patterns. 

IMPACT ON INDUSTRY
Macroscopic analysis of road accident trends may be proved beneficial for the identification of best examples and the implementation of appropriate programmes and measures, which will lead to important benefits for the society and the economy through the reduction of road fatalities and injuries. Best performing countries and the related programmes and measures adopted may concern several safety improvements at the processes of the road, the vehicle and the insurance industries. 

CONCLUSIONS
Lessons from the analysis of the past road safety patterns of developed countries provide some insight into the underlying process that relates motorization levels with personal risk and can prove to be beneficial for predicting the road safety evolution of developing countries that may have not yet reached the same breakpoints. Furthermore, the presented framework may serve as a basis to build more elaborate models, including more reliable exposure indicators (such as vehicle-km driven).},

@article{Cuttis2007,
abstract = {Cervical cancer, the most common cancer affecting women in developing countries, is caused by persistent infection with "high-risk" genotypes of human papillomaviruses (HPV). The most common oncogenic HPV genotypes are 16 and 18, causing approximately 70{\%} of all cervical cancers. Types 6 and 11 do not contribute to the incidence of high-grade dysplasias (precancerous lesions) or cervical cancer, but do cause laryngeal papillomas and most genital warts. HPV is highly transmissible, with peak incidence soon after the onset of sexual activity. A quadrivalent (types 6, 11, 16 and 18) HPV vaccine has recently been licensed in several countries following the determination that it has an acceptable benefit/risk profile. In large phase III trials, the vaccine prevented 100{\%} of moderate and severe precancerous cervical lesions associated with types 16 or 18 among women with no previous infection with these types. A bivalent (types 16 and 18) vaccine has also undergone extensive evaluation and been licensed in at least one country. Both vaccines are prepared from non-infectious, DNA-free virus-like particles produced by recombinant technology and combined with an adjuvant. With three doses administered, they induce high levels of serum antibodies in virtually all vaccinated individuals. In women who have no evidence of past or current infection with the HPV genotypes in the vaccine, both vaccines show {\textgreater} 90{\%} protection against persistent HPV infection for up to 5 years after vaccination, which is the longest reported follow-up so far. Vaccinating at an age before females are exposed to HPV would have the greatest impact. Since HPV vaccines do not eliminate the risk of cervical cancer, cervical screening will still be required to minimize cancer incidence. Tiered pricing for HPV vaccines, innovative financing mechanisms and multidisciplinary partnerships will be essential in order for the vaccines to reach populations in greatest need.},

abstract = {Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are important causes of human disease nearly worldwide. All arboviruses circulate among wild animals, and many cause disease after spillover transmission to humans and agriculturally important domestic animals that are incidental or dead-end hosts. Viruses such as dengue (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses that have lost the requirement for enzootic amplification now produce extensive epidemics in tropical urban centers. Many arboviruses recently have increased in importance as human and veterinary pathogens using a variety of mechanisms. Beginning in 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) underwent a dramatic geographic expansion into the Americas. High amplification associated with avian virulence coupled with adaptation for replication at higher temperatures in mosquito vectors, it has caused the largest epidemic of arboviral encephalitis ever reported in the Americas. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), the most frequent arboviral cause of encephalitis worldwide, has spread throughout most of Asia and as far south as Australia from its putative origin in Indonesia and Malaysia. JEV has caused major epidemics as it invaded new areas, often enabled by rice culture and amplification in domesticated swine. Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), another arbovirus that infects humans after amplification in domesticated animals, undergoes epizootic transmission during wet years following droughts. Warming of the Indian Ocean, linked to the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation in the Pacific, leads to heavy rainfall in east Africa inundating surface pools and vertically-infected mosquito eggs laid during previous seasons. Like WNV, JEV and RVFV could become epizootic and epidemic in the Americas if introduced unintentionally via commerce or intentionally for nefarious purposes. Climate warming also could facilitate the expansion of the distributions of many arboviruses, as documented for bluetongue viruses (BTV), major pathogens of ruminants. BTV, especially BTV-8, invaded Europe after climate warming enabled the major midge vector to expand is distribution northward into southern Europe and extended the transmission season and vectorial capacity of local midge species. Perhaps the greatest health risk of arboviral emergence comes from extensive tropical urbanization and the colonization of this expanding habitat by the highly anthropophilic (attracted to humans) mosquito, Aedes aegypti. These factors led to the emergence of permanent endemic cycles of urban DENV and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), as well as seasonal interhuman transmission of yellow fever and Zika viruses. The recent invasion into the Americas, Europe and Africa of Ae. albopictus, an important CHIKV and secondary DENV vector, could enhance urban transmission of these viruses in tropical as well as temperate regions. The minimal requirements for sustained endemic arbovirus transmission, adequate human viremia and vector competence of Ae. aegypti and/or Ae. albopictus, may be met by two other viruses with the potential to become major human pathogens: Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, already an important cause of neurological disease in humans and equids throughout the Americas, and Mayaro virus, a close relative of CHIKV that produces a comparably debilitating arthralgic disease in South America. Further research is needed to understand the potential of these and other arboviruses to emerge in the future, invade new geographic areas, and become important public and veterinary health problems.},

abstract = {Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) has become an important and extensively researched topic in the literature. Empirical results suggest that EO may influence firm performance. However, it is important to determine whether the EO-performance relationship is sustainable since EO can be a resource-consuming strategic orientation. This research examines the sustainability of the EO-performance relationship; i.e., whether EO affects performance during an extended period of time or is a "quick fix" where performance is only temporarily affected. Using data from Swedish small firms, the results indicate that there is indeed a positive relationship between EO and performance. This relationship also increases over time. The results show that investments in EO may be worthwhile for small firms since they pay off over an extended period of time. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

abstract = {Breast cancer remains a public-health issue on a global scale. We report new information about the disease from the past 5 years. Early age at first birth, increasing parity, and tamoxifen use are related to long-term lifetime reduction in breast-cancer risk. Ductal carcinomas in situ has been suggested to be renamed ductal intraepithelial neoplasia to emphasise its non-life-threatening nature. An alternative approach, the progenitor/stem cell theory, predicts that only some tumour cells cause cancer progression and that these should be targeted by treatment. Mammography and ultrasonography are still the most effective for women with non-dense and dense breast tissues, respectively. Additionally, MRI, lymphatic mapping, the nipple-sparing mastectomy, partial breast irradiation, neoadjuvant systemic therapy, and adjuvant treatments are promising for subgroups of breast-cancer patients. Although tamoxifen can be offered for endocrine-responsive disease, aromatase inhibitors are increasingly used. Assessment of potential molecular targets is now important in primary diagnosis. Tyrosine-kinase inhibitors and other drugs with anti-angiogenesis properties are currently undergoing preclinical investigations.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We examined depression within a multidimensional framework consisting of genetic, environmental, and sociobehavioral factors and, using machine learning algorithms, explored interactions among these factors that might better explain the etiology of depressive symptoms. METHODS: We measured current depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (n = 6378 participants in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study). Genetic factors were 78 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); environmental factors-13 stressful life events (SLEs), plus a composite proportion of SLEs index; and sociobehavioral factors-18 personality, intelligence, and other health or behavioral measures. We performed traditional SNP associations via logistic regression likelihood ratio testing and explored interactions with support vector machines and Bayesian networks. RESULTS: After correction for multiple testing, we found no significant single genotypic associations with depressive symptoms. Machine learning algorithms showed no evidence of interactions. Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes produced the best models in both subsets and included only environmental and sociobehavioral factors. CONCLUSIONS: We found no single or interactive associations with genetic factors and depressive symptoms. Various environmental and sociobehavioral factors were more predictive of depressive symptoms, yet their impacts were independent of one another. A genome-wide analysis of genetic alterations using machine learning methodologies will provide a framework for identifying genetic-environmental-sociobehavioral interactions in depressive symptoms.},

These viruses' capacity for adaptation is notable, as well as the likelihood of their emergence and establishment in new geographic areas. In Brazilian epidemiologic scenario, the most common arboviruses are DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV, although others may spread in the country. Little is yet known of the impact of viral co-circulation, which would theoretically result in more intense viremia or other immunological alterations that could trigger autoimmune diseases, such as Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome. The impact on morbidity and mortality intensifies as extensive epidemics lead to a high number of affected individuals, severe cases, and implications for health services, mainly due to the absence of treatment, vaccines, and effective prevention and control measures.},

abstract = {As a major analytical method for outbreak detection, Kulldorff's space-time scan statistic (2001, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A 164, 61-72) has been implemented in many syndromic surveillance systems. Since, however, it is based on circular windows in space, it has difficulty correctly detecting actual noncircular clusters. Takahashi et al. (2008, International Journal of Health Geographics 7, 14) proposed a flexible space-time scan statistic with the capability of detecting noncircular areas. It seems to us, however, that the detection of the most likely cluster defined in these space-time scan statistics is not the same as the detection of localized emerging disease outbreaks because the former compares the observed number of cases with the conditional expected number of cases. In this article, we propose a new space-time scan statistic which compares the observed number of cases with the unconditional expected number of cases, takes a time-to-time variation of Poisson mean into account, and implements an outbreak model to capture localized emerging disease outbreaks more timely and correctly. The proposed models are illustrated with data from weekly surveillance of the number of absentees in primary schools in Kitakyushu-shi, Japan, 2006.},

abstract = {The use of the K-functions (Ripley, 1977) has recently become popular in the analysis of the spatial pattern of firms. It was first introduced in the economic literature by Arbia and Espa (1996) and then popularized by Marcon and Puech (2003), Quah and Simpson (2003), Duranton and Overman (2005), and Arbia et al. (2008). In particular in Arbia et al. (2008) we used Ripley's K-functions as instruments to study the inter-sectoral co-agglomeration pattern of firms in a single moment of time. All this research has followed a static approach by disregarding the time dimension. Temporal dynamics, on the other hand, play a crucial role in understanding the economic and social phenomena particularly when referring to the analysis of the individual choices leading to the observed clusters of economic activities. With respect to previous contributions to the literature, this paper uncovers the process of firm demography by studying the dynamics of localization through space–time K-functions. The empirical part of the paper will focus on the study of the long run localization of firms in the area of Rome (Italy), by concentrating on the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector data collected by the Italian Industrial Union in the period 1920–2005.},

OBJECTIVE
To describe the characteristics of motorcycle and bicycle accident victims, according to notifications of suspected and confirmed accidents that have occurred in the municipality of S{\~{a}}o Paulo. 

METHOD
This was a descriptive epidemiological study. It covered all accidents (12,924) that occurring involving motorcycles (11,366) and bicycles (1,558) between January 2011 and October 2013. Data in the Health Department's information system for surveillance of violence and accidents (SIVVA) was surveyed. 

RESULTS
Motorcycle accidents accounted for 52.1{\%} of the cases notified and bicycles, 7.1{\%}. Males predominated in both types of accident: 81.6{\%} and 80.6{\%}, respectively. In the motorcycle accidents, the predominant age group among the victims was from 20 to 24 years. Both types of accident occurred during the daytime (7:00 to 18:00 hours): 37.4{\%} and 27.0{\%} respectively. Among the motorcycle accidents, the driver had been using alcohol in 3{\%} of them and it was not possible to identify whether this had occurred in 67{\%}. 

CONCLUSIONS
Public policies prioritizing financial and human resources applied towards reducing these types of accident need to be brought in.},

This multi-patch influenza model consists of a SEIAR influenza transmission model and flow model between two districts. This model is based on the daily confirmed cases of A/H1N1 influenza collected by the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention from April 27 to September 15, 2009 and the daily commuting data from 33 districts of SMA reported in the 2010 Population and Housing Census (PHC). We analyzed the spread patterns of 2009 influenza in the SMA by the reproductive numbers and geographic information systems. During the early period of novel influenza pandemics, when pharmaceutical interventions are lacking, non-pharmaceutical public health interventions will be the most critical strategies for impeding the spread of influenza and delaying an epidemic. Using the spatial-temporal model developed herein, we also investigated the impact of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions, isolation and/or commuting restrictions, on the incidence reduction in various scenarios. Our model provides scientific evidence for predicting the spread of disease and preparedness for a future pandemic.},

abstract = {One of the major applications of future generation parallel and distributed systems is in big-data analytics. Data repositories for such applications currently exceed exabytes and are rapidly increasing in size. Beyond their sheer magnitude, these datasets and associated applications' considerations pose significant challenges for method and software development. Datasets are often distributed and their size and privacy considerations warrant distributed techniques. Data often resides on platforms with widely varying computational and network capabilities. Considerations of fault-tolerance, security, and access control are critical in many applications (Dean and Ghemawat, 2004; Apache hadoop). Analysis tasks often have hard deadlines, and data quality is a major concern in yet other applications. For most emerging applications, data-driven models and methods, capable of operating at scale, are as-yet unknown. Even when known methods can be scaled, validation of results is a major issue. Characteristics of hardware platforms and the software stack fundamentally impact data analytics. In this article, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art and focus on emerging trends to highlight the hardware, software, and application landscape of big-data analytics. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Incidence density of P. vivax recurrence was 45.1/100 patient-years, mostly occurring between the 4th and 13th week after initiating treatment. Male gender, shorter time since onset of symptoms, and higher parasitemia in the initial infection increased the risk of relapse during the year, with a 10{\%} reduction in relative risk for longer symptoms and 11{\%} and 15{\%} increases in relative risk for males and higher initial parasitemia, respectively. However, the results show low clinical relevance for these associations, thereby limiting their applicability to decision-making at the public health level.},

A burgeoning volume of research identifies social factors at the root of much of these inequalities in health. Social determinants are relevant to communicable and non-communicable disease alike. Health status, therefore, should be of concern to policy makers in every sector, not solely those involved in health policy. As a response to this global challenge, WHO is launching a Commission on Social Determinants of Health, which will review the evidence, raise societal debate, and recommend policies with the goal of improving health of the world's most vulnerable people. A major thrust of the Commission is turning public-health knowledge into political action.},

abstract = {The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis postulates an inverted-U-shaped relationship between different pollutants and per capita income, i.e., environmental pressure increases up to a certain level as income goes up; after that, it decreases. An EKC actually reveals how a technically specified measurement of environmental quality changes as the fortunes of a country change. A sizeable literature on EKC has grown in recent period. The common point of all the studies is the assertion that the environmental quality deteriorates at the early stages of economic development/growth and subsequently improves at the later stages. In other words, environmental pressure increases faster than income at early stages of development and slows down relative to GDP growth at higher income levels. This paper reviews some theoretical developments and empirical studies dealing with EKC phenomenon. Possible explanations for this EKC are seen in (i) the progress of economic development, from clean agrarian economy to polluting industrial economy to clean service economy; (ii) tendency of people with higher income having higher preference for environmental quality, etc. Evidence of the existence of the EKC has been questioned from several corners. Only some air quality indicators, especially local pollutants, show the evidence of an EKC. However, an EKC is empirically observed, till there is no agreement in the literature on the income level at which environmental degradation starts declining. This paper provides an overview of the EKC literature, background history, conceptual insights, policy and the conceptual and methodological critique.},

abstract = {The need for policy makers to understand science and for scientists to understand policy processes is widely recognised. However, the science-policy relationship is sometimes difficult and occasionally dysfunctional; it is also increasingly visible, because it must deal with contentious issues, or itself becomes a matter of public controversy, or both. We suggest that identifying key unanswered questions on the relationship between science and policy will catalyse and focus research in this field. To identify these questions, a collaborative procedure was employed with 52 participants selected to cover a wide range of experience in both science and policy, including people from government, non-governmental organisations, academia and industry. These participants consulted with colleagues and submitted 239 questions. An initial round of voting was followed by a workshop in which 40 of the most important questions were identified by further discussion and voting. The resulting list includes questions about the effectiveness of science-based decision-making structures; the nature and legitimacy of expertise; the consequences of changes such as increasing transparency; choices among different sources of evidence; the implications of new means of characterising and representing uncertainties; and ways in which policy and political processes affect what counts as authoritative evidence. We expect this exercise to identify important theoretical questions and to help improve the mutual understanding and effectiveness of those working at the interface of science and policy.},

Much of these data are spatially and temporally referenced and offer many possibilities for enhancing geographical understanding, including for post-positivist scholars. Big data also, however, poses a number of challenges and risks to geographic scholarship and raises a number of taxing epistemological, methodological and ethical questions. Geographers need to grasp the opportunities whilst at the same time tackling the challenges, ameliorating the risks and thinking critically about big data as well as conducting big data studies. Failing to do so could be quite costly as the discipline gets left behind as others leverage insights from the growing data deluge.},

abstract = {Urbanization is one of the fundamental characteristics of the European civilization. It gradually spread from Southeast Europe around 700 b.c., across the whole continent. Cities and the urban networks they formed were always an important factor in the development and shaping of their surrounding regions. Polarization of territory between urban and rural and accessibility are still important aspects in landscape dynamics. Urbanization and its associated transportation infrastructure define the relationship between city and countryside. Urbanization, expressed as the proportion of people living in urban places shows a recent but explosive growth reaching values around 80{\%} in most European countries. Simultaneously the countryside becomes abandoned. Thinking, valuing and planning the countryside is done mainly by urbanites and future rural development is mainly focused upon the urban needs. Thinking of urban places with their associated rural hinterland and spheres of influence has become complex. Clusters of urban places, their situation in a globalizing world and changing accessibility for fast transportation modes are some new factors that affect the change of traditional European cultural landscapes. Urbanization processes show cycles of evolution that spread in different ways through space. Urbanization phases developed at different speeds and time between Northern and Southern Europe. Main cities are affected first, but gradually urbanization processes affect smaller settlements and even remote rural villages. Functional urban regions (FURs) are a new concept, which is also significant for landscape ecologists. Local landscape change can only be comprehended when situated in its general geographical context and with all its related dynamics. Patterns of change are different for the countryside near major cities, for metropolitan villages and for remote rural villages. Planning and designing landscapes for the future requires that this is understood. Urbanized landscapes are highly dynamic, complex and multifunctional. Therefore, detailed inventories of landscape conditions and monitoring of change are urgently needed in order to obtain reliable data for good decision-making.},

The research team identified the general flow of data within clinics. Data was mainly collected from registers, which were later converted to electronic form and checked for duplication. A database was designed for the collection of demographic data (Patient Master Index), which was aimed at eliminating duplication of patients' data in several registers. Open Data Kit (ODK) Collect was setup on Android tablets for collecting disease related routine data, while ODK Aggregate as the storage and aggregates of data captured by ODK Collect and the Patient Master Index for demographic data, were setup on an Apple Mini Mac server. Data collection is in progress. The expected results include improved data quality, reliability and quick access to summary data. Secondly, instant retrieval of patient demographic details and clinic numbers are included. Thirdly, ability to form standard reporting from the SQL database and lastly exporting data into the TIER.net and DHIS systems via CVS files thus eliminating the need for data capturers are shown.},

@article{Cook2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Google Flu Trends (GFT) uses anonymized, aggregated internet search activity to provide near-real time estimates of influenza activity. GFT estimates have shown a strong correlation with official influenza surveillance data. The 2009 influenza virus A (H1N1) pandemic [pH1N1] provided the first opportunity to evaluate GFT during a non-seasonal influenza outbreak. In September 2009, an updated United States GFT model was developed using data from the beginning of pH1N1.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We evaluated the accuracy of each U.S. GFT model by comparing weekly estimates of ILI (influenza-like illness) activity with the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet). For each GFT model we calculated the correlation and RMSE (root mean square error) between model estimates and ILINet for four time periods: pre-H1N1, Summer H1N1, Winter H1N1, and H1N1 overall (Mar 2009-Dec 2009). We also compared the number of queries, query volume, and types of queries (e.g., influenza symptoms, influenza complications) in each model. Both models' estimates were highly correlated with ILINet pre-H1N1 and over the entire surveillance period, although the original model underestimated the magnitude of ILI activity during pH1N1. The updated model was more correlated with ILINet than the original model during Summer H1N1 (r = 0.95 and 0.29, respectively). The updated model included more search query terms than the original model, with more queries directly related to influenza infection, whereas the original model contained more queries related to influenza complications.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Internet search behavior changed during pH1N1, particularly in the categories "influenza complications" and "term for influenza." The complications associated with pH1N1, the fact that pH1N1 began in the summer rather than winter, and changes in health-seeking behavior each may have played a part. Both GFT models performed well prior to and during pH1N1, although the updated model performed better during pH1N1, especially during the summer months.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES What explains increases in BMI (and obesity) over time and across countries? Although many microeconomic forces are likely explanations, increasingly scholars are arguing that macroeconomic forces such as market liberalism and globalization are root causes of the obesity epidemic. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of economic freedom on obesity conditional on the level of income and other factors. STUDY DESIGN We use an unbalanced pooled cross section of up to 135 countries for 1995 and 2000–2009. METHODS Our statistical model specifications include pooled OLS and fixed effects. RESULTS First, we find that controlling for fixed effects siphons off much of the relationship previously documented between economic freedom and BMI. Second, economic freedom is associated with slightly higher BMIs but only for men in developing nations. Lastly, we show that economic freedom increases life expectancy for both men and women in developing countries. CONCLUSION Therefore, policies aimed at reducing obesity that limit economic liberalism may come at the expense of life expectancy in the developing world.},

The value of the global spatial autocorrelation was positive, indicating the presence of groupings that were identified through the spatial association indicators. There are road risk clusters located in areas with a high level of urbanization, low population density, and a high transit flow level. Conclusions. The exploratory analysis of spatial data is a phase that precedes the use of multivariate techniques with a broader scope. The application of exploratory analysis techniques in itself makes it possible to standardize spatial groupings, identify global autocorrelation, and indicate the direction of the variables under study.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Monitoring levels and trends in premature mortality is crucial to understanding how societies can address prominent sources of early death. The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 to 2016. This assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological transition with changes in development and where local patterns deviate from these trends. 

METHODS
We estimated cause-specific deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by age, sex, geography, and year. YLLs were calculated from the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. We used the GBD cause of death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for under-registration and garbage coding; national and subnational verbal autopsy (VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys and surveillance systems for specific causes such as maternal mortality. To facilitate assessment of quality, we reported on the fraction of deaths assigned to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death (major garbage codes) by location and year. Based on completeness, garbage coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, we provided an overall data quality rating for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best). We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for each location, year, age, and sex. We assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific deaths in relation to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of average income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility, with locations grouped into quintiles by SDI. Relative to GBD 2015, we expanded the GBD cause hierarchy by 18 causes of death for GBD 2016. 

FINDINGS
The quality of available data varied by location. Data quality in 25 countries rated in the highest category (5 stars), while 48, 30, 21, and 44 countries were rated at each of the succeeding data quality levels. Vital registration or verbal autopsy data were not available in 27 countries, resulting in the assignment of a zero value for data quality. Deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represented 72{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI] 71{\textperiodcentered}2–73{\textperiodcentered}2) of deaths in 2016 with 19{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} (18{\textperiodcentered}5–20{\textperiodcentered}4) of deaths in that year occurring from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases and a further 8{\textperiodcentered}43{\%} (8{\textperiodcentered}00–8{\textperiodcentered}67) from injuries. Although age-standardised rates of death from NCDs decreased globally between 2006 and 2016, total numbers of these deaths increased; both numbers and age-standardised rates of death from CMNN causes decreased in the decade 2006–16—age-standardised rates of deaths from injuries decreased but total numbers varied little. In 2016, the three leading global causes of death in children under-5 were lower respiratory infections, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma, combined resulting in 1{\textperiodcentered}80 million deaths (95{\%} UI 1{\textperiodcentered}59 million to 1{\textperiodcentered}89 million). Between 1990 and 2016, a profound shift toward deaths at older ages occurred with a 178{\%} (95{\%} UI 176–181) increase in deaths in ages 90–94 years and a 210{\%} (208–212) increase in deaths older than age 95 years. The ten leading causes by rates of age-standardised YLL significantly decreased from 2006 to 2016 (median annualised rate of change was a decrease of 2{\textperiodcentered}89{\%}); the median annualised rate of change for all other causes was lower (a decrease of 1{\textperiodcentered}59{\%}) during the same interval. Globally, the five leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; neoplasms; neonatal disorders; and HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. At a finer level of disaggregation within cause groupings, the ten leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, road injuries, malaria, neonatal preterm birth complications, HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of total YLLs in 113 countries for men and 97 countries for women. Comparisons of observed levels of YLLs by countries, relative to the level of YLLs expected on the basis of SDI alone, highlighted distinct regional patterns including the greater than expected level of YLLs from malaria and from HIV/AIDS across sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes mellitus, especially in Oceania; interpersonal violence, notably within Latin America and the Caribbean; and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe. The level of YLLs from ischaemic heart disease was less than expected in 117 of 195 locations. Other leading causes of YLLs for which YLLs were notably lower than expected included neonatal preterm birth complications in many locations in both south Asia and southeast Asia, and cerebrovascular disease in western Europe. 

INTERPRETATION
The past 37 years have featured declining rates of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases across all quintiles of SDI, with faster than expected gains for many locations relative to their SDI. A global shift towards deaths at older ages suggests success in reducing many causes of early death. YLLs have increased globally for causes such as diabetes mellitus or some neoplasms, and in some locations for causes such as drug use disorders, and conflict and terrorism. Increasing levels of YLLs might reflect outcomes from conditions that required high levels of care but for which effective treatments remain elusive, potentially increasing costs to health systems.

abstract = {Background: The use of a malaria early warning system (MEWS) to trigger prompt public health interventions is a key step in adding value to the epidemiological data routinely collected by sentinel surveillance systems. Methods: This study describes a system using various epidemic thresholds and a forecasting component with the support of new technologies to improve the performance of a sentinel MEWS. Malaria-related data from 21 sentinel sites collected by Short Message Service are automatically analysed to detect malaria trends and malaria outbreak alerts with automated feedback reports. Results: Roll Back Malaria partners can, through a user-friendly web-based tool, visualize potential outbreaks and generate a forecasting model. The system already demonstrated its ability to detect malaria outbreaks in Madagascar in 2014. Conclusion: This approach aims to maximize the usefulness of a sentinel surveillance system to predict and detect epidemics in limited-resource environments. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2017.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Attachment theory has been proven essential for mental health, including psychopathology, development, and interpersonal relationships. Validated psychometric instruments to measure attachment abound but suffer from shortcomings common to traditional psychometrics. Recent developments in multimodal fusion and machine learning pave the way for new automated and objective psychometric instruments for adult attachment that combine psychophysiological, linguistic, and behavioral analyses in the assessment of the construct. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to present a new exposure-based, automatic, and objective adult-attachment assessment, the Biometric Attachment Test (BAT), which exposes participants to a short standardized set of visual and music stimuli, whereas their immediate reactions and verbal responses, captured by several computer sense modalities, are automatically analyzed for scoring and classification. We also aimed to empirically validate two of its assumptions: its capacity to measure attachment security and the viability of using themes as placeholders for rotating stimuli. METHODS: A total of 59 French participants from the general population were assessed using the Adult Attachment Questionnaire (AAQ), the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP), and the Attachment Multiple Model Interview (AMMI) as ground truth for attachment security. They were then exposed to three different BAT stimuli sets, whereas their faces, voices, heart rate (HR), and electrodermal activity (EDA) were recorded. Psychophysiological features, such as skin-conductance response (SCR) and Bayevsky stress index; behavioral features, such as gaze and facial expressions; as well as linguistic and paralinguistic features, were automatically extracted. An exploratory analysis was conducted using correlation matrices to uncover the features that are most associated with attachment security. A confirmatory analysis was conducted by creating a single composite effects index and by testing it for correlations with attachment security. The stability of the theory-consistent features across three different stimuli sets was explored using repeated measures analysis of variances (ANOVAs). RESULTS: In total, 46 theory-consistent correlations were found during the exploration (out of 65 total significant correlations). For example, attachment security as measured by the AAP was correlated with positive facial expressions (r=.36, P=.01). AMMI's security with the father was inversely correlated with the low frequency (LF) of HRV (r=-.87, P=.03). Attachment security to partners as measured by the AAQ was inversely correlated with anger facial expression (r=-.43, P=.001). The confirmatory analysis showed that the composite effects index was significantly correlated to security in the AAP (r=.26, P=.05) and the AAQ (r=.30, P=.04) but not in the AMMI. Repeated measures ANOVAs conducted individually on each of the theory-consistent features revealed that only 7 of the 46 (15{\%}) features had significantly different values among responses to three different stimuli sets. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to validate two of the instrument's core assumptions: its capacity to measure attachment security and the viability of using themes as placeholders for rotating stimuli. Future validation of other of its dimensions, as well as the ongoing development of its scoring and classification algorithms is discussed.},

abstract = {This paper draws together work on the event to problematise the generative implications of anticipatory governance in the management of emerging infectious disease. Through concerns for preparedness, the need to anticipate outbreaks of disease has taken on a new urgency. With the identification of the H1N1 virus circulating amongst human populations in 2009, public health measures and security practices at regional, national and international levels were rapidly put into play. However, as the ensuing event demonstrated, the social, political and economic disruptions of emerging infectious diseases can be matched by those of anticipatory actions. I argue that the event-making potential of surveillance practices and the pre-determined arrangements of influenza preparedness planning, when triggered by the H1N1 virus, caused an event acceleration through the hyper-sensitised global health security architecture. In the UK, this led to a bureaucratic reflex, a security response event that overtook the present actualities of the disease. This raises questions about the production of forms of insecurity by the security apparatus itself.},

The most radical difference is perhaps between the philosophical sense, which has of course a well-established tradition, and the computational sense, which emerged in the recent years in the knowledge engineering community, starting from an early informal definition of (computational) ontologies as “explicit specifications of conceptualizations”. In this paper we shall revisit the previous attempts to clarify and formalize such original definition, providing a detailed account of the notions of conceptualization and explicit specification, while discussing at the same time the importance of shared explicit specifications},

abstract = {Temporal, behavioral and social risk factors that affect injuries resulting from alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes have been characterized in previous research. Much less is known about spatial patterns and environmental associations of alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes. The aim of this study was to evaluate geographic patterns of alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes and to determine if locations of alcohol outlets are associated with those crashes. In addition, we sought to demonstrate the value of integrating spatial and traditional statistical techniques in the analysis of this preventable public health risk. The study design was a cross-sectional analysis of individual-level blood alcohol content, traffic report information, census block group data, and alcohol distribution outlets. Besag and Newell's spatial analysis and traditional logistic regression both indicated that areas of low population density had more alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes than expected (P {\textless} 0.05). There was no significant association between alcohol outlets and alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes using distance analyses, logistic regression, and Chi-square. Differences in environmental or behavioral factors characteristic of areas of low population density may be responsible for the higher proportion of alcohol-related crashes occurring in these areas. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We consider a system of nonlinear partial differential equations corresponding to a generalization of a mathematical model for geographical spreading of dengue disease proposed in the article by Maidana and Yang (2008) [5]. As in that article, the mosquito population is divided into subpopulations: winged form (mature female mosquitoes) and aquatic form (comprising eggs, larvae and pupae); the human population is divided into the subpopulations: susceptible, infected and removed (or immune). On the other hand, differently from the work by Maidana and Yang, who considered just the one dimensional case with constant coefficients, in the present we allow higher spatial dimensions and also parameters depending on space and time. This last generalization is done to cope with possible abiotic effects as variations in temperature, humidity, wind velocity, carrier capacities, and so on; thus, the results hold for more realistic situations. Moreover, we also consider the effects of additional control terms. We perform a rigorous mathematical analysis and present a result on existence and uniqueness of solutions of the problem; furthermore, we obtain estimates of the solution in terms of certain norms of the given parameters of the problem. This kind of result is important for the analysis of optimal control problems with the given dynamics; to exemplify their utility, we also briefly describe how they can be used to show the existence of optimal controls that minimize a given optimality criteria.},

abstract = {Relationships and the pattern of relationships have a large and varied influence on both individual and group action. The fundamental distinction of social network analysis research is that relationships are of paramount importance in explaining behavior. Because of this, social network analysis offers many exciting tools and techniques for research and practice in a wide variety of medical and public health situations including organizational improvements, understanding risk behaviors, coordinating coalitions, and the delivery of health care services. This book provides an introduction to the major theories, methods, models, and findings of social network analysis research and application. In three sections, it presents a comprehensive overview of the topic; first in a survey of its historical and theoretical foundations, then in practical descriptions of the variety of methods currently in use, and finally in a discussion of its specific applications for behavior change in a public health context. Throughout, the text has been kept clear, concise, and comprehensible, with short mathematical formulas for some key indicators or concepts. Researchers and students alike will find it an invaluable resource for understanding and implementing social network analysis in their own practice.},

abstract = {Background Health impact assessment (HIA) studies are increasingly predicting the health effects of mode shifts in traffic. The challenge for such studies is to combine the health effects, caused by injuries, with the disease driven health effects, and to express the change in the health with a common health indicator. Disability-adjusted life year (DALY) combines years lived disabled or injured (YLD) and years of life lost (YLL) providing practical indicator to combine injuries with diseases. In this study, we estimate the average YLDs for one person injured in a transport crash to allow easy to use methods to predict health effects of transport injuries. Methods We calculated YLDs and YLLs for transport fatalities and injuries based on the data from the Swedish Traffic Accident Data Acquisition (STRADA). In STRADA, all the fatalities and most of the injuries in Sweden for 2007–2011 were recorded. The type of injury was recorded with the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) codes. In this study these AIS codes were aggregated to injury types, and YLDs were calculated for each victim by multiplying the type of injury with the disability weight and the average duration of that injury. YLLs were calculated by multiplying the age of the victim with life expectancy of that age and gender. YLDs and YLLs were estimated separately for different gender, mode of transport and location of the crash. Results The average YLDs for injured person was 14.7 for lifelong injuries and 0.012 for temporal injuries. The average YLDs per injured person for lifelong injuries for pedestrians, cyclists and car occupants were 9.4, 12.8 and 18.4, YLDs, respectively. Lifelong injuries sustained in rural areas were on average 31{\%} more serious than injuries in urban areas. Conclusions The results show that shifting modes of transport will not only change the likelihood of injuries but also the severity of injuries sustained, if injured. The results of this study can be used to predict DALY changes in HIA studies that take into account mode shifts between different transport modes, and in other studies predicting the health effects of traffic injuries.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early detection of disease outbreaks enables public health officials to implement disease control and prevention measures at the earliest possible time. A time periodic geographical disease surveillance system based on a cylindrical space-time scan statistic has been used extensively for disease surveillance along with the SaTScan software. In the purely spatial setting, many different methods have been proposed to detect spatial disease clusters. In particular, some spatial scan statistics are aimed at detecting irregularly shaped clusters which may not be detected by the circular spatial scan statistic. RESULTS: Based on the flexible purely spatial scan statistic, we propose a flexibly shaped space-time scan statistic for early detection of disease outbreaks. The performance of the proposed space-time scan statistic is compared with that of the cylindrical scan statistic using benchmark data. In order to compare their performances, we have developed a space-time power distribution by extending the purely spatial bivariate power distribution. Daily syndromic surveillance data in Massachusetts, USA, are used to illustrate the proposed test statistic. CONCLUSION: The flexible space-time scan statistic is well suited for detecting and monitoring disease outbreaks in irregularly shaped areas.},

abstract = {President Obama has been clear on his desire to normalize trade relations with Cuba, and the two bills being considered in Congress would dismantle the embargo. Given the bipartisan backing of legislation and growing public support, a complete repeal of the Cuban embargo may occur soon. The result will be mostly beneficial for the US medical and public health communities, but will also create a new market for American medical tourism. Potential collaborations should be guided by the shared principles of equitable access to health care and may open up a new era of cooperation to achieve common global health goals, which- in the end-may also encourage democracy.},

abstract = {The article discusses the relationship between communication and neglect, from their overlapping in public health, particularly the concept of neglected diseases.   It is set in a set of scientific-academic and political concerns on the subject of invisibility and its reverse, visibility as health and communication problems.   His argument rests on statements: communication is evidence and determining factor of neglect and should be among the indicators that characterize a neglected disease;   communication can be considered neglected when perseveres in the old models and practices, acts centrally, focuses exclusively speech institutional, ignores the context, is treated as information and not as dialogue;   the neglected communication denies principles of the Unified Health System The approach includes the characterization of neglected diseases.;   visibility as a constitutive feature of modern times;   the relationship between invisibility, neglect and care;   the characterization of what is meant as "neglected communication";   the relationship between communication, neglect and SUS principles.   It is concluded that the communication that we need to ensure the right to health need to promote the recognition of it and those who are not on the scene.},

abstract = {The fatalities from Road Traffic Accidents (RTA) constitute a major cause of unnatural deaths among children in Chandigarh zone of North West India. The epidemiology of RTA related deaths in this age group is lacking in our country. This retrospective study (1974–2013) included children (⩽18years) who became victims of RTA and subsequently died during the course of treatment. The postmortem and hospital records of the victims were used to collect the epidemiological data regarding age, sex, area of residence, etc. These deaths constituted 9.4{\%} of total road accident deaths reported at this hospital. Out of a total of 709 RTA deaths in children, about 16{\%} were reported in the block year of 1974–78 and this proportion decreased to 9.4{\%} during the block year of 1984–88 and has remained almost constant since then. The maximum number of victims belonged to the states of Haryana (36{\%}) and Punjab (34{\%}). A higher number of deaths were observed in rural population (60{\%}). Most of the fatalities occurred between 12–4pm (29.9{\%}) and pedestrians (47.8{\%}) were found to be the most commonly affected. The most common affected was the 16–18year age group (35.3{\%}). Injury to head and neck region (81.4{\%}) was responsible for a majority of deaths. The study concluded that the RTA remains an important cause of unnatural deaths in children. The static proportion of these deaths over the past three decades signifies that the road safety policies have been ineffective in preventing causalities and need further improvements.},

abstract = {The main challenges in international health are to scale up effective health interventions in low- and middle-income countries in order to reach a higher proportion of the population. This can be achieved through better insight into how health systems are structured. Social network analysis can provide an appropriate and innovative paradigm for the health systems researcher, allow new analyses of the structure of health systems, and facilitate understanding of the role of stakeholders within a health system. The social network analysis methodology adapted to health systems research and described in detail by the authors comprises three main stages: (i) describing the set of actors and members of the network; (ii) characterizing the relationships between actors; and (iii) analysing the structure of the systems. Evidence generated through social network analysis could help policy makers to understand how health systems react over time and to better adjust health programmes and innovations to the capacities of health systems in low- and middle-income countries to achieve universal coverage.},

These approaches highlight the differences between how individuals and groups of people conceptualize risk2. Social Psychology approach: Various authors take this approach, Mythen lists only Paul Slovic specifically. a. This focuses on the risk and individual cognition3. Governmentality: Of course this comes from Foucault but also includes Castel, O'Malley, and Dean. a. This approach focuses on the state as the actor in conceptualizing risk and the ways in which the state manages populations by that justification.4. Risk Society approach: This comes from Ulrich Beck but also includes Anthony Giddens and Annemarie Mol amongst othersa. This focuses on how humans have produced certain types of risk with modernization and technologization. This focus looks to the individualized experience of risk and the changing logic of risk distribution (eg from population level to individual level).},

There are more than 20 different cancer-associated HPV types, but little is known about their geographic variation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPURPOSE: Our aim was to determine whether the association between HPV infection and cervical cancer is consistent worldwide and to investigate geographic variation in the distribution of HPV types.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: More than 1000 specimens from sequential patients with invasive cervical cancer were collected and stored frozen at 32 hospitals in 22 countries. Slides from all patients were submitted for central histologic review to confirm the diagnosis and to assess histologic characteristics. We used polymerase chain reaction-based assays capable of detecting more than 25 different HPV types. A generalized linear Poisson model was fitted to the data on viral type and geographic region to assess geographic heterogeneity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: HPV DNA was detected in 93{\%} of the tumors, with no significant variation in HPV positivity among countries. HPV 16 was present in 50{\%} of the specimens, HPV 18 in 14{\%}, HPV 45 in 8{\%}, and HPV 31 in 5{\%}. HPV 16 was the predominant type in all countries except Indonesia, where HPV 18 was more common. There was significant geographic variation in the prevalence of some less common virus types. A clustering of HPV 45 was apparent in western Africa, while HPV 39 and HPV 59 were almost entirely confined to Central and South America. In squamous cell tumors, HPV 16 predominated (51{\%} of such specimens), but HPV 18 predominated in adenocarcinomas (56{\%} of such tumors) and adenosquamous tumors (39{\%} of such tumors).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the role of genital HPVs, which are transmitted sexually, as the central etiologic factor in cervical cancer worldwide. They also suggest that most genital HPVs are associated with cancer, at least occasionally.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIMPLICATION: The demonstration that more than 20 different genital HPV types are associated with cervical cancer has important implications for cervical cancer-prevention strategies that include the development of vaccines targeted to genital HPVs.},

We seek to contribute to future studies of urbanization and health by exploring multiple definitions of urbanicity in the Philippines, using data from an ongoing, longitudinal study. We use factor analysis to identify meaningful clusters of household- and community-level variables, and to generate factor scores that summarize each household's position with respect to access to infrastructure and health services, and level of affluence. Factor scores are considered for 1983 and 1994 to assess the type and pace of change that has occurred in the Philippines, and scores are compared across urban and rural areas, and across six different settlement types, to explore household- and community-level markers of urbanicity. This analysis demonstrates the heterogeneity of environments within urban and rural areas, and emphasizes the need for a finer level of investigation in future studies of urbanization and health.},

Degree, betweenness, and closeness centralities are defined only for classically simple graphs-those with strictly binary relations between vertices. Looking only at these classical graphs, where eigenvectors and graph-theoretic measures are competitors, eigenvector centrality is designed to be distinctively different from mere degree centrality when there are some high degree positions connected to many low degree others or some low degree positions are connected to a few high degree others. Therefore, it will not be distinctively different from degree when positions are all equal in degree (regular graphs) or in core-periphery structures in which high degree positions tend to be connected to each other. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A recent WHO analysis has revealed the need for a new world standard population (see attached table). This has become particularly pertinent given the rapid and continued declines in age-specific mortality rates among the oldest old, and the increasing availability of epidemiological data for higher age groups. There is clearly no conceptual justification for choosing one standard over another, hence the choice is arbitrary. However, choosing a standard population with higher proportions in the younger age groups tends to weight events at these ages disproportionately. Similarly, choosing an older standard does the opposite. Hence, rather than selecting a standard to match the current age-structure of some population(s), the WHO adopted a standard based on the average age-structure of those populations to be compared (the world) over the likely period of time that a new standard will be used (some 25-30 years), using the latest UN assessment for 1998 (UN Population Division, 1998). From these estimates, an average world population age-structure was constructed for the period 2000-2025. The use of an average world population, as well as a time series of observations, removes the effects of historical events such as wars and famine on population age composition. The terminal age group in the new WHO standard population has been extended out to 100 years and over, rather than the 85 and over as is the current practice. The WHO World Standard population has fewer children and notably more adults aged 70 and above than the world standard. It is also notably younger than the European standard. It is important to note, however, that the age standardized death rates based on the new standard are not comparable to previous estimates that are based on some earlier standard(s). However, to facilitate comparative analyses, WHO will disseminate trend analyses of the “complete” historical mortality data using on the new WHO World Standard Population in future editions of the World Health Statistics Annual. 2},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Since Murray and Lopez's 1996 seminal study on burden of disease, the disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) has become a valuable tool to measure the health loss of populations and evaluate health-system performance. Such indicators are essential in a country like Brazil, marked with rapidly changing epidemiology and wide regional inequalities. This study presents timely subnational estimates of burden of disease in Brazil in 2008 to inform health policy. 

METHODS
DALYs are the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). Mortality data were used to estimate YLLs for Brazil, with adjustments for incomplete information on cause of death, sex, and age. YLDs were estimated from multiple sources, including health databases, literature reviews, and expert consensus. 

FINDINGS
We estimated a national average of 195 DALYs per 1000 inhabitants (95{\%} CI 194–196) in 2008. Five causes accounted for almost a third of total DALYs: depression (8{\textperiodcentered}31{\%}, 95{\%} CI 8{\textperiodcentered}31–8{\textperiodcentered}32), ischaemic heart disease (6{\textperiodcentered}78{\%}, 6{\textperiodcentered}76–6{\textperiodcentered}80), diabetes (4{\textperiodcentered}72{\%}, 4{\textperiodcentered}70–4{\textperiodcentered}74), stroke (4{\textperiodcentered}60{\%}, 4{\textperiodcentered}58–4{\textperiodcentered}61), and homicide/violence (3{\textperiodcentered}70{\%}, 3{\textperiodcentered}69–3{\textperiodcentered}71). Large regional disparities were found: from a low of 177 DALYs per 1000 inhabitants (95{\%} CI 177–178) in the Central West region to a high of 209 per 1000 inhabitants (208–210) in the Northeast. In the (more affluent) Southeast and South regions, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was a greater contributor to health loss than homicide/violence. Neonatal sepsis and birth trauma and asphyxia were among the 20 principal DALY contributors in the (poorer) North and Northeast regions. 

INTERPRETATION
Non-communicable chronic diseases, mental health, and injuries weigh heavily on the Brazilian epidemiological profile. However, in the more vulnerable regions, the North and Northeast, diseases associated with poverty and health-system precariousness persist. Health policies need to consider the balance between acute care services and chronic care management to meet population health needs across the country. More research is needed on the underlying social and economic determinants contributing to disparities in health outcomes.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: All aspects of the heath care sector are being asked to account for their performance. This poses unique challenges for local public health units with their traditional focus on population health and their emphasis on disease prevention, health promotion and protection. Reliance on measures of health status provides an imprecise and partial picture of the performance of a health unit. In 2004 the provincial Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences based in Ontario, Canada introduced a public-health specific balanced scorecard framework. We present the conceptual deliberations and decisions undertaken by a health unit while adopting the framework. DISCUSSION: Posing, pondering and answering key questions assisted in applying the framework and developing indicators. Questions such as: Who should be involved in developing performance indicators? What level of performance should be measured? Who is the primary intended audience? Where and how do we begin? What types of indicators should populate the health status and determinants quadrant? What types of indicators should populate the resources and services quadrant? What type of indicators should populate the community engagement quadrant? What types of indicators should populate the integration and responsiveness quadrants? Should we try to link the quadrants? What comparators do we use? How do we move from a baseline report card to a continuous quality improvement management tool? SUMMARY: An inclusive, participatory process was chosen for defining and creating indicators to populate the four quadrants. Examples of indicators that populate the four quadrants of the scorecard are presented and key decisions are highlighted that facilitated the process.},

Then comes the publication of the results of your research, and the published literature is just the tip of the data iceberg. By this I mean that people collect a lot of data and then reduce this down to some number of column inches in Science or Nature-or 10 pages if it is a computer science person writing. So what I mean by data iceberg is that there is a lot of data that is collected but not curated or published in any systematic way. There are some exceptions, and I think that these cases are a good place for us to look for best practices.

abstract = {Health research priority setting processes assist researchers and policymakers in effectively targeting research that has the greatest potential public health benefit. Many different approaches to health research prioritization exist, but there is no agreement on what might constitute best practice. Moreover, because of the many different contexts for which priorities can be set, attempting to produce one best practice is in fact not appropriate, as the optimal approach varies per exercise. Therefore, following a literature review and an analysis of health research priority setting exercises that were organized or coordinated by the World Health Organization since 2005, we propose a checklist for health research priority setting that allows for informed choices on different approaches and outlines nine common themes of good practice. It is intended to provide generic assistance for planning health research prioritization processes. The checklist explains what needs to be clarified in order to establish the context for which priorities are set; it reviews available approaches to health research priority setting; it offers discussions on stakeholder participation and information gathering; it sets out options for use of criteria and different methods for deciding upon priorities; and it emphasizes the importance of well-planned implementation, evaluation and transparency.},

abstract = {The evolution of motorcycle ownership is a crucial issue for road safety, as motorcyclists are highly vulnerable road users. Analyzing a panel of 153 countries for the period 1963–2010, we document a motorcycle Kuznets curve which sees motorcycle dependence increase and then decrease as economies develop. Upswings in motorcycle ownership are particularly pronounced in densely populated countries. We also present macro-level evidence on the additional road fatalities associated with motorcycles. Our results indicate that many low-income countries face the prospect of an increasing number of motorcycle-related deaths over coming years unless adequate safety initiatives are implemented.},

abstract = {Road traffic injuries (RTIs) are a leading cause of morbidity, disability and mortality in less developed countries. Globally in 2002, 1.2 million deaths resulted from RTIs, and about 10 times that were injured. RTIs are often preventable, and the technology and knowledge to achieve success in this area exist. In spite of this, it is projected that given the current trend and without adequate intervention, RTIs will rank third of all major causes of morbidity and mortality globally by 2020. Although {\textgreater} 85{\%} of the global deaths and injuries from road traffic crashes occur in less developed countries, traffic safety attracts little public health attention in these nations, due in part to a plethora of other equally important problems, including infectious diseases. Unfortunately, the public health and economic impact of traffic-related injuries and disabilities can be incalculable in these countries, owing to their poorly developed trauma care systems and nonexistent social welfare infrastructures to accommodate the needs of the injured and the disabled. In this paper, we highlight the problem posed to public health in less developed countries by RTIs and examine contributing factors. To engender debate and action to address the problem, we reviewed interventions that have proven effective in industrialized nations and discussed potential barriers to their replication in less developed countries.},

Total annual expenditure was predicted using age, sex, geography, inpatient diagnoses, and hierarchical condition category variables. The methods included regression, penalized regression, decision trees, neural networks, and an ensemble super learner, all in concert with screening algorithms that reduce the set of variables considered. The performance of these methods was compared based on cross-validated R(2) .$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our results indicate that a simplified risk adjustment formula selected via this nonparametric framework maintains much of the efficiency of a traditional larger formula.

" —Midwest Book Review Designing a complete visualization system involves many subtle decisions. When designing a complex, real-world visualization system, such decisions involve many types of constraints, such as performance, platform (in)dependence, available programming languages and styles, user-interface toolkits, input/output data format constraints, integration with third-party code, and more. Focusing on those techniques and methods with the broadest applicability across fields, the second edition of Data Visualization: Principles and Practice provides a streamlined introduction to various visualization techniques. The book illustrates a wide variety of applications of data visualizations, illustrating the range of problems that can be tackled by such methods, and emphasizes the strong connections between visualization and related disciplines such as imaging and computer graphics. It covers a wide range of sub-topics in data visualization: data representation; visualization of scalar, vector, tensor, and volumetric data; image processing and domain modeling techniques; and information visualization.},

METHODS: descriptive study with demographic Census data from 1950 to 2010, and estimates of demographic dynamics published by Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics and Interagency Health Information Network. RESULTS: since 1950, the process of demographic transition in Brazil has been characterized by the drop of mortality, birth and fecundity rates. The age structure started its ageing process. These changes have not simultaneously nor evenly occurred in Brazilian regions. While Southeast, South and Midwest are more advanced in the process of transition, North and Northeast still present mortality and fecundity rates more elevated, and age structures less aged. CONCLUSION: even though the fecundity levels had declined below reposition level in most parts of Brazil, the demographic balance with low mortality and birth rates has not been achieved yet.},

abstract = {In many older US cities, lead (Pb) contamination of residential soil is widespread; however, contamination is not uniform. Empirically based, spatially explicit models can assist city agencies in addressing this important public health concern by identifying areas predicted to exceed public health targets for soil Pb contamination. Sampling of 61 residential properties in Baltimore City using field portable X-ray fluorescence revealed that 53 {\%} had soil Pb that exceeded the USEPA reportable limit of 400 ppm. These data were used as the input to three different spatially explicit models: a traditional general linear model (GLM), and two machine learning techniques: classification and regression trees (CART) and Random Forests (RF). The GLM revealed that housing age, distance to road, distance to building, and the interactions between variables explained 38 {\%} of the variation in the data. The CART model confirmed the importance of these variables, with housing age, distance to building, and distance to major road networks determining the terminal nodes of the CART model. Using the same three predictor variables, the RF model explained 42 {\%} of the variation in the data. The overall accuracy, which is a measure of agreement between the model and an independent dataset, was 90 {\%} for the GLM, 83 {\%} for the CART model, and 72 {\%} for the RF model. A range of spatially explicit models that can be adapted to changing soil Pb guidelines allows managers to select the most appropriate model based on public health targets.},

It will only be through improved education of healthcare professionals and through an increase in the number of well-trained workers in health and medical informatics that this lack of knowledge and associated skills can begin to be reversed. Although we can recognize further progress in educating health and a considerable number of educational programs for health informatics/medical informatics specialists have been set up, there is still a need to enhance these educational activities world wide, considering global developments as well as new curricular concepts and technological opportunities.

abstract = {Glucose concentration in type 1 diabetes is a function of biological and environmental factors which present high inter-patient variability. The objective of this study is to evaluate a number of features, which are extracted from medical and lifestyle self-monitoring data, with respect to their ability to predict the short-term subcutaneous (s.c.) glucose concentration of an individual. Random forests (RF) and RReliefF algorithms are first employed to rank the candidate feature set. Then, a forward selection procedure follows to build a glucose predictive model, where features are sequentially added to it in decreasing order of importance. Predictions are performed using support vector regression or Gaussian processes. The proposed method is validated on a dataset of 15 type diabetics in real-life conditions. The s.c. glucose profile along with time of the day and plasma insulin concentration are systematically highly ranked, while the effect of food intake and physical activity varies considerably among patients. Moreover, the average prediction error converges in less than d/2 iterations (d is the number of features). Our results suggest that RF and RReliefF can find the most informative features and can be successfully used to customize the input of glucose models.},

However, the multiple inequalities revealed by H1N1 itself in 2009 still provide important insights into the future of global health in the context of market-led globalization. These lessons relate to at least four main forms of inequality: (1) inequalities in blame for the outbreak in the media; (2) inequalities in risk management; (3) inequalities in access to medicines; and (4) inequalities encoded in the actual emergence of new flu viruses.},

abstract = {This paper reports the results of an empirical analysis of the Kuznets curve relationship between per capita income and road fatalities across 60 countries over the period 1972–2004. This relationship hypothesizes that the number of road fatalities increases with increasing motorization in the early stages of economic growth. Eventually, due to advances in technical, policy and political institutions, it declines as per capita income increases. The quality of political institutions as well as improvements in medical care and technology are hypothesized to impact road fatalities. Results indicate evidence of a Kuznets curve relationship between per capita income and road fatalities for both highly developed and less developed countries and support our hypothesis that changes in institutional quality and medical improvements underlie the Kuznets relationship. The evidence presented in this study suggests that lowering corruption levels as well as improvements in medical care and technology would help to reduce road fatalities.},

abstract = {Objectives To enhance the early detection of emerging infectious diseases and bioterrorism events using companion animal-based surveillance. Methods Washington, DC, small animal veterinary facilities (n = 17) were surveyed to determine interest in conducting infectious disease surveillance. Using these results, an electronic-based online reporting system was developed and launched in August 2015 to monitor rates of canine influenza, canine leptospirosis, antibiotic resistant infections, canine parvovirus, and syndromic disease trends. Results Nine of the 10 facilities that responded expressed interest conducting surveillance. In September 2015, 17 canine parvovirus cases were reported. In response, a campaign encouraging regular veterinary preventative care was launched and featured on local media platforms. Additionally, during the system's first year of operation it detected 5 canine leptospirosis cases and 2 antibiotic resistant infections. No canine influenza cases were reported and syndromic surveillance compliance varied, peaking during National Special Security Events. Conclusions Small animal veterinarians and the general public are interested in companion animal disease surveillance. The system described can serve as a model for establishing similar systems to monitor disease trends of public health importance in pet populations and enhance biosurveillance capabilities.},

It focuses on the broader concept of "infectious disease policy" as a method for preventing and treating infectious diseases, and as a path for the creation of healthy communities. Infectious disease policy broadens the biological perspective of infectious disease control and highlights the common obstacles to policy and intervention, obstacles, which include poverty, inequity, environmental factors, access, and the interrelationship between individuals and communities with health structures. Developing such a policy will encourage a change in focus from purely biomedical program approach to a process-oriented policy approach, which will enable infectious disease control to be integrated, flexible, sensitive to global, national and local contexts, and directly involved in the creation of healthy communities.},

In response, visual analytics (VA) has gained attention, yet its solutions haven't scaled well for big data. Computational methods can improve VA's scalability by giving users compact, meaningful information about the input data. However, the significant computation time these methods require hinders real-time interactive visualization of big data. By addressing crucial discrepancies between these methods and VA regarding precision and convergence, researchers have proposed ways to customize them for VA. These approaches, which include low-precision computation and iteration-level interactive visualization, ensure real-time interactive VA for big data.},

abstract = {We document an open-source toolbox for drawing large-scale undirected graphs. This toolbox is based on a previously implemented closed-source algorithm known as VxOrd. Our toolbox, which we call OpenOrd, extends the capabilities of VxOrd to large graph layout by incorporating edge-cutting, a multi-level approach, average-link clustering, and a parallel implementation. At each level, vertices are grouped using force-directed layout and average-link clustering. The clustered vertices are then re-drawn and the process is repeated. When a suitable drawing of the coarsened graph is obtained, the algorithm is reversed to obtain a drawing of the original graph. This approach results in layouts of large graphs which incorporate both local and global structure. A detailed description of the algorithm is provided in this paper. Examples using datasets with over 600K nodes are given. Code is available at www.cs.sandia.gov/{\~{}}smartin.},

Although this may seem revolu- tionary, in fact it may be better described as evolu- tionary. Some of the issues raised by data-driven geography have in fact been longstanding issues in geographic research, namely, large data volumes, dealing with populations and messy data, and tensions between idiographic versus nomothetic knowledge. The belief that spatial context matters is a major theme in geographic thought and a major motivation behind approaches such as time geography, disaggregate spatial statistics and GIScience. There is potential to use Big Data to inform both geographic knowledge- discovery and spatial modeling. However, there are challenges, such as how to formalize geographic knowledge to clean data and to ignore spurious patterns, and how to build data-driven models that are both true and understandable.},

abstract = {Acid mine drainage (AMD) is a global problem that may have serious human health and environmental implications. Laboratory and field tests are commonly used for predicting AMD, however, this is challenging since its formation varies from site-to-site for a number of reasons. Furthermore, these tests are often conducted at small-scale over a short period of time. Subsequently, extrapolation of these results into large-scale setting of mine sites introduce huge uncertainties for decision-makers. This study presents machine learning techniques to develop models to predict AMD quality using historical monitoring data of a mine site. The machine learning techniques explored in this study include artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine with polynomial (SVM-Poly) and radial base function (SVM-RBF) kernels, model tree (M5P), and K-nearest neighbors (K-NN). Input variables (physico-chemical parameters) that influence drainage dynamics are identified and used to develop models to predict copper concentrations. For these selected techniques, the predictive accuracy and uncertainty were evaluated based on different statistical measures. The results showed that SVM-Poly performed best, followed by the SVM-RBF, ANN, M5P, and KNN techniques. Overall, this study demonstrates that the machine learning techniques are promising tools for predicting AMD quality.},

abstract = {Detection of space-time clusters is an important function in various domains (e.g., epidemiology and public health). The pioneering work on the spatial scan statistic is often used as the basis to detect and evaluate such clusters. State-of-the-art systems based on this approach detect clusters with restrictive shapes that cannot model growth and shifts in location over time. We extend these methods significantly by using the flexible square pyramid shape to model such effects. A heuristic search method is developed to detect the most likely clusters using a randomized algorithm in combination with geometric shapes processing. The use of Monte Carlo methods in the original scan statistic formulation is continued in our work to address the multiple hypothesis testing issues. Our method is applied to a real data set on brain cancer occurrences over a 19 year period. The cluster detected by our method shows both growth and movement which could not have been modeled with the simpler cylindrical shapes used earlier. Our general framework can be extended quite easily to handle other flexible shapes for the space-time clusters.},

abstract = {We review literature that uses spatial analytic tools in contexts where Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is the organizing system for health data or where the methods discussed will likely be incorporated in GIS-based analyses in the future. We conclude the review with the point of view that this literature is moving toward the development and use of systems of analysis that integrate the information geo-coding and data base functions of GISystems with the geo-information processing functions of GIScience. The rapidity of this projected development will depend on the perceived needs of the public health community for spatial analysis methods to provide decision support. Recent advances in the analysis of disease maps have been influenced by and benefited from the adoption of new practices for georeferencing health data and new ways of linking such data geographically to potential sources of environmental exposures, the locations of health resources and the geodemographic characteristics of populations. This review focuses on these advances.},

abstract = {Detailed information on health linked to geographic, sociodemographic, and environmental data are required by city governments to monitor health and the determinants of health. These data are critical for guiding local interventions, resource allocation, and planning decisions, yet they are too often non-existent or scattered. This study aimed to develop a conceptual framework of Urban Health Observatories (UHOs) as an institutional mechanism which can help synthesize evidence and incorporate it into urban policy-making for health and health equity. A survey of a select group of existent UHOs was conducted using an instrument based on an a priori conceptual framework of key structural and functional characteristics of UHOs. A purposive sample of seven UHOs was surveyed, including four governmental, two non-governmental, and one university-based observatory, each from a different country. Descriptive and framework analysis methods were used to analyze the data and to refine the conceptual framework in light of the empirical data. The UHOs were often a product of unique historical circumstances. They were relatively autonomous and capable of developing their own locally sensitive agenda. They often had strong networks for accessing data and were able to synthesize them at the urban level as well as disaggregate them into smaller units. Some UHOs were identified as not only assessing but also responding to local needs. The findings from this study were integrated into a conceptual framework which illustrates how UHOs can play a vital role in monitoring trends in health determinants, outcomes, and equity; optimizing an intersectoral urban information system; incorporating research on health into urban policies and systems; and providing technical guidance on research and evidence-based policy making. In order to be most effective, UHOs should be an integral part of the urban governance system, where multiple sectors of government, the civil society, and businesses can participate in taking the right actions to promote health equity.},

abstract = {Background The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of risk factor exposure and attributable burden of disease. By providing estimates over a long time series, this study can monitor risk exposure trends critical to health surveillance and inform policy debates on the importance of addressing risks in context. Methods We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to estimate levels and trends in exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, sex, year, and location for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2016. This study included 481 risk-outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or probable evidence of causation. We extracted relative risk (RR) and exposure estimates from 22 717 randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources, according to the GBD 2016 source counting methods. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. Finally, we explored four drivers of trends in attributable burden: population growth, population ageing, trends in risk exposure, and all other factors combined. Findings Since 1990, exposure increased significantly for 30 risks, did not change significantly for four risks, and decreased significantly for 31 risks. Among risks that are leading causes of burden of disease, child growth failure and household air pollution showed the most significant declines, while metabolic risks, such as body-mass index and high fasting plasma glucose, showed significant increases. In 2016, at Level 3 of the hierarchy, the three leading risk factors in terms of attributable DALYs at the global level for men were smoking (124{\textperiodcentered}1 million DALYs [95{\%} UI 111{\textperiodcentered}2 million to 137{\textperiodcentered}0 million]), high systolic blood pressure (122{\textperiodcentered}2 million DALYs [110{\textperiodcentered}3 million to 133{\textperiodcentered}3 million], and low birthweight and short gestation (83{\textperiodcentered}0 million DALYs [78{\textperiodcentered}3 million to 87{\textperiodcentered}7 million]), and for women, were high systolic blood pressure (89{\textperiodcentered}9 million DALYs [80{\textperiodcentered}9 million to 98{\textperiodcentered}2 million]), high body-mass index (64{\textperiodcentered}8 million DALYs [44{\textperiodcentered}4 million to 87{\textperiodcentered}6 million]), and high fasting plasma glucose (63{\textperiodcentered}8 million DALYs [53{\textperiodcentered}2 million to 76{\textperiodcentered}3 million]). In 2016 in 113 countries, the leading risk factor in terms of attributable DALYs was a metabolic risk factor. Smoking remained among the leading five risk factors for DALYs for 109 countries, while low birthweight and short gestation was the leading risk factor for DALYs in 38 countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. In terms of important drivers of change in trends of burden attributable to risk factors, between 2006 and 2016 exposure to risks explains an 9{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} (6{\textperiodcentered}9–11{\textperiodcentered}6) decline in deaths and a 10{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (8{\textperiodcentered}3–13{\textperiodcentered}1) decrease in DALYs at the global level, while population ageing accounts for 14{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (12{\textperiodcentered}7–17{\textperiodcentered}5) of deaths and 6{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} (3{\textperiodcentered}9–8{\textperiodcentered}7) of DALYs, and population growth for 12{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (10{\textperiodcentered}1–14{\textperiodcentered}9) of deaths and 12{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (10{\textperiodcentered}1–14{\textperiodcentered}9) of DALYs. The largest contribution of trends in risk exposure to disease burden is seen between ages 1 year and 4 years, where a decline of 27{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} (24{\textperiodcentered}9–29{\textperiodcentered}7) of the change in DALYs between 2006 and 2016 can be attributed to declines in exposure to risks. Interpretation Increasingly detailed understanding of the trends in risk exposure and the RRs for each risk-outcome pair provide insights into both the magnitude of health loss attributable to risks and how modification of risk exposure has contributed to health trends. Metabolic risks warrant particular policy attention, due to their large contribution to global disease burden, increasing trends, and variable patterns across countries at the same level of development. GBD 2016 findings show that, while it has huge potential to improve health, risk modification has played a relatively small part in the past decade.},

abstract = {Starting in the late 1980s, many Latin American countries began social sector reforms to alleviate poverty, reduce socioeconomic inequalities, improve health outcomes, and provide financial risk protection. In particular, starting in the 1990s, reforms aimed at strengthening health systems to reduce inequalities in health access and outcomes focused on expansion of universal health coverage, especially for poor citizens. In Latin America, health-system reforms have produced a distinct approach to universal health coverage, underpinned by the principles of equity, solidarity, and collective action to overcome social inequalities. In most of the countries studied, government financing enabled the introduction of supply-side interventions to expand insurance coverage for uninsured citizens-with defined and enlarged benefits packages-and to scale up delivery of health services. Countries such as Brazil and Cuba introduced tax-financed universal health systems. These changes were combined with demand-side interventions aimed at alleviating poverty (targeting many social determinants of health) and improving access of the most disadvantaged populations. Hence, the distinguishing features of health-system strengthening for universal health coverage and lessons from the Latin American experience are relevant for countries advancing universal health coverage.},

abstract = {Breast cancer remains a major and growing threat to global Public Health: the global burden currently exceeds 1.6 million new cases annually and has been increasing at an annual rate of 3.1 per cent. The World Breast Cancer Report captures the global nature of breast cancer; the rapid increase in incidence; disparities in awareness and response to symptoms; disparities in the availability of diagnostic facilities, treatment options and availability; and consequent major disparities in breast cancer outcome. Reports from lower income countries highlight the late presentation of women with breast cancer to treatment providers, frequently when palliation is the only treatment option. Lower resource countries lack adequate treatment facilities and when treatment is possible, the range of options is limited and, frequently, not state of the art. The large proportion of women presenting with metastatic disease is much higher in lower resource countries than in higher resource countries. Many lower resource countries lack significant palliation resources, including an absence of radiotherapy and no availability of opioid medication. Paracetamol is not an effective treatment for the pain frequently associated with terminal cancer. Prospects for primary prevention of breast cancer remain limited. Many risk factors are not easily modifiable. Moderating alcohol consumption, avoiding overweight and increasing physical activity would lead to decreases in risk as would an increase in duration of breast feeding. With the global tendency to breast feed each child for a shorter period and to have fewer children, the major benefit of this lifestyle choice seems limited. Despite more new cases being diagnosed in the developed countries, the 450,000 annual breast cancer deaths are equally divided between the developing and developed world. Increasing population size and life expectancy, accompanied by a decrease in stigma, an increase in awareness and the introduction of effective early detection programmes in lower resource countries will lead to an increase in the numbers of new cases diagnosed. Global priorities must be to reduce the number of women developing and dying from breast cancer and to eliminate the major disparities which currently exist. Strategies for primary prevention remain in the research domain while continual progress in the treatment of breast cancer is advancing slowly but surely. Epidemiology must adapt quickly to this new situation.},

abstract = {Lesion analysis is a classic approach to study brain functions. Because brain function is a result of coherent activations of a collection of functionally related voxels, lesion-symptom relations are generally contributed by multiple voxels simultaneously. Although voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) has made substantial contributions to the understanding of brain-behavior relationships, a better understanding of the brain-behavior relationship contributed by multiple brain regions needs a multivariate lesion-symptom mapping (MLSM). The purpose of this artilce was to develop an MLSM using a machine learning-based multivariate regression algorithm: support vector regression (SVR). In the proposed SVR-LSM, the symptom relation to the entire lesion map as opposed to each isolated voxel is modeled using a nonlinear function, so the intervoxel correlations are intrinsically considered, resulting in a potentially more sensitive way to examine lesion-symptom relationships. To explore the relative merits of VLSM and SVR-LSM we used both approaches in the analysis of a synthetic dataset. SVR-LSM showed much higher sensitivity and specificity for detecting the synthetic lesion-behavior relations than VLSM. When applied to lesion data and language measures from patients with brain damages, SVR-LSM reproduced the essential pattern of previous findings identified by VLSM and showed higher sensitivity than VLSM for identifying the lesion-behavior relations. Our data also showed the possibility of using lesion data to predict continuous behavior scores.},

We examined socio-demographic and geographical determinants of RTA mortality in Switzerland by linking 2000 census data to RTA mortality records 2000-2005 (ICD-10 codes V00-V99). Data from 5.5 million residents aged 18-94 years, 1744 study areas, and 1620 RTA deaths were analyzed, including 978 deaths (60.4{\%}) in motor vehicle occupants, 254 (15.7{\%}) in motorcyclists, 107 (6.6{\%}) in cyclists, and 259 (16.0{\%}) in pedestrians. Weibull survival models and Bayesian methods were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR), and standardized mortality ratios (SMR) across study areas. Adjusted HR comparing women with men ranged from 0.04 (95{\%} CI 0.02-0.07) in motorcyclists to 0.43 (95{\%} CI 0.32-0.56) in pedestrians. There was a u-shaped relationship with age in motor vehicle occupants and motorcyclists. In cyclists and pedestrians, mortality increased after age 55 years. Mortality was higher in individuals with primary education (HR 1.53; 95{\%} CI 1.29-1.81), and higher in single (HR 1.24; 95{\%} CI 1.05-1.46), widowed (HR 1.31; 95{\%} CI 1.05-1.65) and divorced individuals (HR 1.62; 95{\%} CI 1.33-1.97), compared to persons with tertiary education or married persons. The association with education was particularly strong for pedestrians (HR 1.87; 95{\%} CI 1.20-2.91). RTA mortality increased with decreasing population density of study areas for motor vehicle occupants (test for trend p{\textless}0.0001) and motorcyclists (p=0.0021) but not for cyclists (p=0.39) or pedestrians (p=0.29). SMR standardized for socio-demographic and geographical variables ranged from 82 to 190. Prevention efforts should aim to reduce inequities across socio-demographic and educational groups, and across geographical areas, with interventions targeted at high-risk groups and areas, and different traffic users, including pedestrians.},

abstract = {For more than a century, epidemiology has seen major shifts in both focus and methodology. Taking into consideration the explosion of "big data," the advent of more sophisticated data collection and analytical tools, and the increased interest in evidence-based solutions, we present a framework that summarizes 3 fundamental domains of epidemiologic methods that are relevant for the understanding of both historical contributions and future directions in public health. First, the manner in which populations and their follow-up are defined is expanding, with greater interest in online populations whose definition does not fit the usual classification by person, place, and time. Second, traditional data collection methods, such as population-based surveillance and individual interviews, have been supplemented with advances in measurement. From biomarkers to mobile health, innovations in the measurement of exposures and diseases enable refined accuracy of data collection. Lastly, the comparison of populations is at the heart of epidemiologic methodology. Risk factor epidemiology, prediction methods, and causal inference strategies are areas in which the field is continuing to make significant contributions to public health. The framework presented herein articulates the multifaceted ways in which epidemiologic methods make such contributions and can continue to do so as we embark upon the next 100 years.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dengue and malaria are two major arthropod-borne infections in tropical areas, but dual infections were only described for the first time in 2005. Reports of these concomitant infections are scarce and there is no evidence of more severe clinical and biological pictures than single infections. METHODS: To compare co-infections to dengue alone and malaria alone, a retrospective matched-pair study was conducted between 2004 and 2010 among patients admitted in the emergency department of Cayenne hospital, French Guiana. RESULTS: 104 dengue and malaria co-infection cases were identified during the study period and 208 individuals were matched in two comparison groups: dengue alone and malaria alone. In bivariate analysis, co-infection clinical picture was more severe than separated infections, in particular using the severe malaria WHO criteria. In multivariate analysis, independent factors associated with co-infection versus dengue were: masculine gender, CRP level {\textgreater} 50 mg/L, thrombocytopaenia {\textless} 50 109/L, and low haematocrit {\textless}36{\%} and independent factors significantly associated with co-infections versus malaria were red cells transfusion, low haematocrit {\textless} 36{\%}, thrombocytopaenia {\textless} 50 109/L and low Plasmodium parasitic load {\textless} 0.001{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, dengue and malaria co-infection clinical picture seems to be more severe than single infections in French Guiana, with a greater risk of deep thrombocytopaenia and anaemia.},

First, the rhetoric of health is analysed in historical perspective, briefly considering the main elements of the discourse of the ideological movements that historically built the social field of health. Medical Police, Social Medicine and Public Health are included as representative of such movements in 19th century Western Europe. After the Flexnerian turn, these movements were followed by Preventive Medicine, Community Health, Primary Health Care and Health Promotion, which dominated the scene particularly in the second half of the 20th century. The authors also summarise recent concerted PAHO efforts to debate the theory and practice of Public Health in the Americas, vis {\`{a}} vis the emerging demands of the economic, political and social context of Latin American countries. In this regard, the need for a common political agenda is emphasized , with the convergence of three topics - sectorial reform, "Renovation of Health for All" and the "new public health", covering the conceptual, methodological and operative domains. Secondly, a brief systematic account of the conceptual landmarks of the Collective Health movement, as carried through in the two last decades in Latin America, is presented, focusing more particularly on its potential for building up both a domain of transdisciplinary knowledge and a universe of practices. As a field of knowledge, it contributes to the study of health-disease phenomena in populations as a social process, investigating the production and distribution of disease in society as an aspect of social reproduction, and analysing health practices as a labor process integrated into the other social practices. As a universe of practices, Collective Health focuses on its models or action guidelines four objects of intervention: policies (forms of power distribution); practices (behavior modification; culture; institutions; knowledge production; institutional, professional and relational practices); technologies (organization and regulation of productive resources and processes; bodies/environments), and instruments (means of production of interventions). Finally, it is concluded that, although not being in itself a paradigm, Collective Health, as a movement committed to the social transformation of health, presents some possibilities of articulation with new scientific paradigms capable of approaching the health-disease-care object with due regard to its historicity and complexity.},

abstract = {Causation is an essential concept in epidemiology, yet there is no single, clearly articulated definition for the discipline. From a systematic review of the literature, five categories can be delineated: production, necessary and sufficient, sufficient-component, counterfactual, and probabilistic. Strengths and weaknesses of these categories are examined in terms of proposed characteristics of a useful scientific definition of causation: it must be specific enough to distinguish causation from mere correlation, but not so narrow as to eliminate apparent causal phenomena from consideration. Two categories-production and counterfactual-are present in any definition of causation but are not themselves sufficient as definitions. The necessary and sufficient cause definition assumes that all causes are deterministic. The sufficient-component cause definition attempts to explain probabilistic phenomena via unknown component causes. Thus, on both of these views, heavy smoking can be cited as a cause of lung cancer only when the existence of unknown deterministic variables is assumed. The probabilistic definition, however, avoids these assumptions and appears to best fit the characteristics of a useful definition of causation. It is also concluded that the probabilistic definition is consistent with scientific and public health goals of epidemiology. In debates in the literature over these goals, proponents of epidemiology as pure science tend to favour a narrower deterministic notion of causation models while proponents of epidemiology as public health tend to favour a probabilistic view. The authors argue that a single definition of causation for the discipline should be and is consistent with both of these aims. It is concluded that a counterfactually-based probabilistic definition is more amenable to the quantitative tools of epidemiology, is consistent with both deterministic and probabilistic phenomena, and serves equally well for the acquisition and the application of scientific knowledge.},

abstract = {The poorer countries of the world continue to struggle with an enormous health burden from diseases that we have long had the capacity to eliminate. Similarly, the health systems of some countries, rich and poor alike, are fragmented and inefficient, leaving many population groups underserved and often without health care access entirely. Cuba represents an important alternative example where modest infrastructure investments combined with a well-developed public health strategy have generated health status measures comparable with those of industrialized countries. Areas of success include control of infectious diseases, reduction in infant mortality, establishment of a research and biotechnology industry, and progress in control of chronic diseases, among others. If the Cuban experience were generalized to other poor and middle-income countries human health would be transformed. Given current political alignments, however, the major public health advances in Cuba, and the underlying strategy that has guided its health gains, have been systematically ignored. Scientists make claims to objectivity and empiricism that are often used to support an argument that they make unique contributions to social welfare. To justify those claims in the arena of international health, an open discussion should take place on the potential lessons to be learned from the Cuban experience.},

abstract = {Examining the similarities and differences in urbanization pattern between cities in developed and developing countries may enhance our understanding of urbanization processes and mechanisms. Using a buffer analysis approach, we compared the long-term spatiotemporal patterns of urbanization between Guangzhou of China and Phoenix of the United States during the 20th century, with a particular emphasis on the impacts of major roads and rivers. The development of Guangzhou was relatively compact, whereas the development of Phoenix was much more dispersed. The two metropolitan areas were characterized mainly by two types of urban expansion processes. Guangzhou experienced a diffusion–coalescence–diffusion–coalescence process while Phoenix experienced a diffusion–coalescence process. The buffer analysis indicated that the impacts of roads and rivers on the urbanization of Guangzhou and Phoenix were similar in terms of urban area, the number of urban patches, the mean patch size, but different in terms of the complexity of urban patches. The urban area declined with increasing distances to roads, but it increased when the distance was close to the rivers and then declined with the increment of distances to rivers. In general, the impacts of roads are stronger in Phoenix than in Guangzhou, while the impacts of rivers are greater in Guangzhou than in Phoenix. These similarities and differences between the two metropolitan regions are reflective of those in both physical conditions and land use policies in the two countries. By comparing these similarities and differences, we can improve our understanding of the urbanization processes in both developed and developing countries, which is necessary for achieving global urban sustainability.},

abstract = {This article challenges the status of Fixed Effects models as the default modelling option when using time-series cross-sectional and panel data. We show that a complete understanding of the difference between within and between effects of predictor variables is important in considering what modelling strategy to use. We show that the main problem of Random Effects modelling - endogenous variables - is in fact a case of omitted variable bias that is readily solvable using a variant of the Mundlak (1978a) formulation. Consequently, Random Effects modelling provides everything that Fixed Effects modelling promises, and much more. Crucially it allows the modelling of time-invariant variables, and does so in a more parsimonious and explicit way than an alternative, Pl{\"{u}}mper and Troegers Fixed Effects Vector Decomposition (2007). It is also readily extendable to a Random Coefficients Model, allowing reliable, differential effects of variables without heavy parameterisation. As such we are arguing not simply for a technical solution to endogeneity, but for the substantive importance of modelling context, and the ability of Random Effects modelling to do so. Our empirical examples then show that failing to do this can lead to very misleading results. The distinctive focus of this paper is the stress on the substantive interpretation of the within and between relations. This has implications that extend beyond the realm of political science, to all datasets that have a multilevel structure.},

abstract = {Cross-country statistics have revealed steady growth in the number of motorcycles in many less advanced economic countries (LAEC) with emerging economies due to increased urbanisation and personal wealth. In contrast, an opposite trend is occurring in advanced economic countries (AEC), with cars replacing motorcycles as income grows. Motor vehicle crashes and injuries are an inevitable consequence of a high motorcycle population. This study focused on understanding how economic growth affects the motorcycle to passenger car (MPC) ownership ratio and what factors underlie this relationship. The data used in this analysis contained a sample of 80 countries at various levels of economic developmental growth over the 48-year period between 1963 and 2010. The results pointed to an inverted U-shaped relationship between the MPC ownership ratio and the per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Generally, the MPC ownership ratio increased with income at a lower level and decreased with income at a higher level. The evidence indicated that urbanisation, the total road length per thousand population, and a proxy for purchasing power with regard to vehicle purchases were the underlying factors that contributed to this relationship.},

In this paper, we define some of the terms used in relat ion to indicators. We outline some of the most important issues around selection and construction of indicators, and we include criteria for developing or assessing indicators. Use of inappropriate indicators can be misleading and can result in negative consequences for public health, and we point out the potential for pitfalls. Some misinterpretation of indicators could be avoided by use of better methods of presentation than the familiar league table.

This rapid review fills this gap by exploring the population impact of initiatives which sought to address social determinants of health. It took a novel approach to synthesizing a sample of the enormous UK literature on community engagement. The synthesis found no evidence of positive impacts on population health or the quality of services, but initiatives did have positive impacts on housing, crime, social capital and community empowerment. Methodological developments are needed to enable studies of complex social interventions to provide robust evidence of population impact in relation to community engagement. },

A published estimate of 23.7{\%} based on an erroneous calculation has been widely quoted. This paper combines 1987 Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) data from 26 states that recorded blood alcohol concentrations for over 84{\%} of fatally injured drivers with published estimates on how alcohol affects crash risk. By categorizing all traffic fatalities as either nonoccupants of vehicles, or occupants killed in single-vehicle, two-vehicle or three-or-more-vehicle crashes, and developing calculation procedures appropriate for each category, the fraction of all fatalities due to alcohol was inferred. The main finding was that eliminating alcohol would reduce traffic fatalities by (47 +/- 4){\%}. It was also concluded that alcohol use changes from 1982 to 1987 have reduced traffic fatalities by 12{\%} (6,400 fatalities), which helps explain the absence of the fatality increase predicted because of a buoyant economy. Reducing the fraction of fatalities due to alcohol from the 1987 value of 47{\%} to 42{\%} (say) would reduce all traffic fatalities by 8{\%}.},

However, for a variety of historical reasons, transport and land use are quite divorced in practice. Typical transport engineers only touch land use planning courses once at most, and only then if they attend graduate school. Land use planners understand transport the way everyone does, from the perspective of the traveler, not of the system, and are seldom exposed to transport aside from, at best, a lone course in graduate school. This text aims to bridge the chasm, helping engineers understand the elements of access that are associated not only with traffic, but also with human behavior and activity location, and helping planners understand the technology underlying transport engineering, the processes, equations, and logic that make up the transport half of the accessibility measure. It aims to help both communicate accessibility to the public.},

Most changes in MVC mortality associated with economic development were explained by changes in rates among nonmotorized travelers, especially pedestrians. Overall MVC rates were lowest when pedestrian exposure was low because there were few motor vehicles or few pedestrians, and were highest during a critical transition to motorized travel, when many pedestrians and other vulnerable road users vied for use of the roadways with many motor vehicles.},

abstract = { A common theme in the Centennial Issue of the American Political Science Review was how subfields have grown more specialized and insulated from one another. In this essay I argue that this trend has been hastened by the inappropriate incorporation of paradigm mentalities, first presented by Thomas Kuhn and later developed by Imre Lakatos. I show how paradigm mentalities help justify rigid opposition to theoretical alternatives and limit critical insight. While paradigm mentalities may be fitting for disciplines that demonstrate Kuhn's concrete scientific achievements, they constrain the study of political science and international relations in particular. I begin with a primer that compares Kuhn and Lakatos to Karl Popper. Next, I point to harmful consequences resulting from applying paradigm mentalities to the study of international relations. Among these is the tendency to act as if realism has earned the status of a paradigm and then invoke criteria of incommensurability and “subsumption” to deflect criticism. I conclude by discussing how Popper's model of science provides a better platform for the study of politics by encouraging theoretical and methodological pluralism. },

abstract = {The era of big data provides many opportunities for conducting impactful research from both data-driven and theory-driven perspectives. However, data-driven and theory-driven research have progressed somewhat independently. In this paper, we develop a framework that articulates important differences between these two perspectives and propose a role for information systems research at their intersection. The framework presents a set of pathways that combine the data-driven and theory-driven perspectives. From these pathways, we derive a set of challenges, and show how they can be addressed by research in information systems. By doing so, we identify an important role that information systems research can play in advancing both data-driven and theory-driven research in the era of big data.},

abstract = {Individual level risk factors for violence have been widely studied, but little is known about country-level determinants, particularly in low and middle-income countries. We hypothesized that income inequality, through its detrimental effects on social cohesion, would be related to an increase in violence worldwide, and in low and middle-income countries in particular. We examined country-level associations of violence with socio-economic and health-related factors, using crime statistics from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and indicators from the Human Development Report published by the United Nations Development Programme. Using regression models, we measured relationships between country-level factors (age, education, measures of income, health expenditure, and alcohol consumption) and four violent outcomes (including measures of violence-related mortality and morbidity) in up to 169 countries. We stratified our analyses comparing high with low and middle-income countries, and analysed longitudinal data on homicide and income inequality in high-income countries. In low and middle-income countries, income inequality was related to homicide, robbery, and self-reported assault (all p's {\textless} 0.05). In high-income countries, urbanicity was significantly associated with official assault (p = 0.002, $\beta$ = 0.716) and robbery (p = 0.011, $\beta$ = 0.587) rates; income inequality was related to homicide (p = 0.006, $\beta$ = 0.670) and self-reported assault (p = 0.020, $\beta$ = 0.563), and longitudinally with homicide (p = 0.021). Worldwide, alcohol consumption was associated with self-reported assault rates (p {\textless} 0.001, $\beta$ = 0.369) suggesting public policy interventions reducing alcohol consumption may contribute to reducing violence rates. Our main finding was that income inequality was related to violence in low and middle-income countries. Public health should advocate for global action to moderate income inequality to reduce the global health burden of violence.},

abstract = {The threat of bioterrorism has stimulated interest in enhancing public health surveillance to detect disease outbreaks more rapidly than is currently possible. To advance research on improving the timeliness of outbreak detection, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency sponsored the Bio-event Advanced Leading Indicator Recognition Technology (BioALIRT) project beginning in 2001. The purpose of this paper is to provide a synthesis of research on outbreak detection algorithms conducted by academic and industrial partners in the BioALIRT project. We first suggest a practical classification for outbreak detection algorithms that considers the types of information encountered in surveillance analysis. We then present a synthesis of our research according to this classification. The research conducted for this project has examined how to use spatial and other covariate information from disparate sources to improve the timeliness of outbreak detection. Our results suggest that use of spatial and other covariate information can improve outbreak detection performance. We also identified, however, methodological challenges that limited our ability to determine the benefit of using outbreak detection algorithms that operate on large volumes of data. Future research must address challenges such as forecasting expected values in high-dimensional data and generating spatial and multivariate test data sets.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This study explores whether gender, age and race differences in oral sexual behavior account for the demographic distribution of oral human papillomavirus infection (HPV) and HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer (HPV-OSCC).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: This analysis included 2,116 men and 2,140 women from NHANES (2009-10) who answered a behavioral questionnaire and provided an oral-rinse sample for HPV detection. Weighted prevalence estimates and prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated for sexual behaviors and oral HPV infection by gender, age-cohort (20-29, 30-44, 45-59, 60-69), and race, and contrasted with incidence rate ratios (IRR) of OSCC from SEER 2009. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate predictors of oral sexual behavior and oral HPV16 infection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Differences in oral sexual behavior were observed by gender, age-cohort and race. Most men (85.4{\%}) and women (83.2{\%}) had ever performed oral sex, but men had more lifetime oral and vaginal sexual partners and higher oral HPV16 prevalence than women (each p{\textless}0.001). 60-69 year olds (yo) were less likely than 45-59 or 30-44 (yo) to have performed oral sex (72.7{\%}, 84.8{\%}, and 90.3{\%}, p{\textless}0.001), although oral HPV16 prevalence was similar. Prevalence ratios (PR) of ever oral sex in men vs. women (PR = 1.03), and 45-59 vs. 30-44 year-old men (PR = 0.96) were modest relative to ratios for oral HPV16 infection (PRs = 1.3-6.8) and OSCC (IRR = 4.7-8.1). In multivariate analysis, gender, age-cohort, and race were significant predictors of oral sexual behavior. Oral sexual behavior was the primary predictor of oral HPV16 infection; once this behavior was adjusted for, age-cohort and race were no longer associated with oral HPV16.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: There are differences in oral sexual behaviors when considering gender, age-cohort and race which explain observed epidemiologic differences in oral HPV16 infection across these groups.},

METHOD This study attempted to find factors associated with such a reduction using historical data of Virginia. Specifically, the study related 18 factors to seven traffic safety measures. RESULTS In terms of annual changes, the study found that typical crash exposures were not generally associated with the seven measures, while two economic indicators (unemployment rate and U.S. Consumer Price Index [CPI]) were strongly associated with most of them. Annual changes in the CPI and unemployment rate explained about half of the annual changes in total and fatal crash counts, respectively, in general not in a specific year.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND In recent decades middle-income countries have experienced a rapid increase in the number of cars and motorcycles. Increased deaths and hospitalizations due to road traffic injuries (RTI) has been observed in several countries as a result. In this study we assessed the determinants of RTIs in Brazil by mode of transportation and compared differences in RTI rates among macro-regions. METHODS We used data from the National Health Survey (NHS) conducted in 2013 by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics and the Ministry of Health. NHS is a comprehensive household survey which includes a representative sample (N = 60,198) of individuals aged 18 years or older. The prevalence and determinants of RTI were estimated according to different modes of transport (car/van, motorcycle, and other) and regions of the country. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were applied to assess crude and adjusted odds ratios, respectively, and their 95 {\%} CI for RTI determinants. RESULTS The prevalence of RTI for the Southeast, South, Central-West, Northeast and North regions of Brazil was 2.4 {\%}, 2.9 {\%}, 4.4 {\%}, 3.4 {\%} and 4.8 {\%}, respectively, pointing to important differences among regions. High percentages of motorcyclists were observed in the Northeast and North regions. For motorcyclists, factors associated with RTIs were being male (OR = 2.6;95 {\%} CI:2.3;3.0), aged 18-29 (OR = 3.2; 95 {\%} CI:2.7;3.8) and 30-39 years (OR = 2.0;95 {\%} CI:1.7;2.5), black (OR = 1.4;95 {\%} CI:1.1;1.7), having elementary educational (OR = 1.5;95 {\%} CI:1.1;1.9), reporting binge drinking behavior (OR = 1.3;95 {\%} CI:1.1;1.5), and living in the Central-West (OR = 2.0;95 {\%} CI:1.6;2.5), Northeast (OR = 1.8;95 {\%} CI:1.5;2.1) and North (OR = 2.0;95 {\%} CI:1.6; 2.5) regions of the country. The independent variables associated with RTI for car/van occupants were being male (OR = 1.7;95 {\%} CI:1.4;2.1), aged 18-29 (OR = 1.5;95 {\%} CI:1.1;2.0) and 30-39 years (OR = 2.5;95 {\%} CI:1.9;3.2), reporting binge drinking behavior (OR = 2.0;95 {\%} CI:1.6;2.5) and living in the South region (OR = 1.6;95 {\%} CI:1.3;2.1). CONCLUSIONS There were considerable regional disparities in RTI rates across Brazil's regions. Motorcyclists contributed to the high RTI rates in these regions as did demographic factors and behaviors such as alcohol use. These findings can help guide interventions to reduce the burden of RTIs in Brazil.},

abstract = {"Heart failure (HF) is a frequent health problem with high morbidity and mortality, increasing prevalence and escalating healthcare costs" [1]. By calculating a HF survival risk score based on patient-specific characteristics from Electronic Health Records (EHRs), we can identify high-risk patients and apply individualized treatment and healthy living choices to potentially reduce their mortality risk. The Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM) is one of the most popular models to calculate HF survival risk that uses multiple clinical variables to predict HF prognosis and also incorporates impact of HF therapy on patient outcomes. Although the SHFM has been validated across multiple cohorts [1-5], these studies were primarily done using clinical trials databases that do not reflect routine clinical care in the community. Further, the impact of contemporary therapeutic interventions, such as beta-blockers or defibrillators, was incorporated in SHFM by extrapolation from external trials. In this study, we assess the performance of SHFM using EHRs at Mayo Clinic, and sought to develop a risk prediction model using machine learning techiniques that applies routine clinical care data. Our results shows the models which were built using EHR data are more accurate (11{\%} improvement in AUC) with the convenience of being more readily applicable in routine clinical care.

abstract = {As a key principle of Primary Health Care (PHC) and Health Systems Reform, community participation has a prominent place in the current global dialogue. Participation is not only promoted in the context of provision and utilization of health services. Advocates also highlight participation as a key factor in the wider context of the importance of social determinants of health and health as a human right. However, the evidence that directly links community participation to improved health status is not strong. Its absence continues to be a barrier for governments, funding agencies and health professionals to promote community participation. The purpose of this article is to review research seeking to link community participation with improved health status outcomes programmes. It updates a review undertaken by the author in 2009. The search includes published articles in the English language and examines the evidence of in the context of health care delivery including services and promotion where health professionals have defined the community's role. The results show that in most studies community participation is defined as the intervention seeking to identify a direct causal link between participation and improved health status modeled on Randomized Control studies (RCT). The majority of studies show it is not possible to examine the link because there is no standard definition of 'community' and 'participation'. Where links are found, they are situation-specific and are unpredictable and not generalizable. In the discussion, an alternative research framework is proposed arguing that community participation is better understood as a process. Once concrete interventions are identified (i.e. improved birth outcomes) then the processes producing improved health status outcomes can be examined. These processes may include and can lead to community uptake, ownership and sustainability for health improvements. However, more research is needed to ensure their validity.},

abstract = {Influenza circulation and mortality impact in tropical areas have not been well characterized. The authors studied the seasonality of influenza throughout Brazil, a geographically diverse country, by modeling influenza-related mortality and laboratory surveillance data. Monthly time series of pneumonia and influenza mortality were obtained from 1979 to 2001 for each of the 27 Brazilian states. Detrended time series were analyzed by Fourier decomposition to describe the amplitude and timing of annual and semiannual epidemic cycles, and the resulting seasonal parameters were compared across latitudes, ranging from the equator (+5 degrees N) to the subtropics (-35 degrees S). Seasonality in mortality was most pronounced in southern states (winter epidemics, June-July), gradually attenuated toward central states (15 degrees S) (p {\textless} 0.001), and remained low near the equator. A seasonal southward traveling wave of influenza was identified across Brazil, originating from equatorial and low-population regions in March-April and moving toward temperate and highly populous regions over a 3-month period. Laboratory surveillance data from recent years provided independent confirmation that mortality peaks coincided with influenza virus activity. The direction of the traveling wave suggests that environmental forces (temperature, humidity) play a more important role than population factors (density, travel) in driving the timing of influenza epidemics across Brazil.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: South Africa is one of many countries committed to malaria elimination with a target of 2018 and all malaria-endemic provinces, including Mpumalanga, are increasing efforts towards this ambitious goal. The reduction of imported infections is a vital element of an elimination strategy, particularly if a country is already experiencing high levels of imported infections. Border control of malaria is one tool that may be considered.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A metapopulation, non-linear stochastic ordinary differential equation model is used to simulate malaria transmission in Mpumalanga and Maputo province, Mozambique (the source of the majority of imported infections) to predict the impact of a focal screen and treat campaign at the Mpumalanga-Maputo border. This campaign is simulated by nesting an individual-based model for the focal screen and treat campaign within the metapopulation transmission model.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The model predicts that such a campaign, simulated for different levels of resources, coverage and take-up rates with a variety of screening tools, will not eliminate malaria on its own, but will reduce transmission substantially. Making the campaign mandatory decreases transmission further though sub-patent infections are likely to remain undetected if the diagnostic tool is not adequately sensitive. Replacing screening and treating with mass drug administration results in substantially larger decreases as all (including sub-patent) infections are treated before movement into Mpumalanga.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The reduction of imported cases will be vital to any future malaria control or elimination strategy. This simulation predicts that FSAT at the Mpumalanga-Maputo border will be unable to eliminate local malaria on its own, but may still play a key role in detecting and treating imported infections before they enter the country. Thus FSAT may form part of an integrated elimination strategy where a variety of interventions are employed together to achieve malaria elimination.},

abstract = {Beyond the hype of Big Data, something within business intelligence projects is indeed changing. This is mainly because Big Data is not only about data, but also about a complete conceptual and technological stack including raw and processed data, storage, ways of managing data, processing and analytics. A challenge that becomes even trickier is the management of the quality of the data in Big Data environments. More than ever before the need for assessing the Quality-in-Use gains importance since the real contribution-business value-of data can be only estimated in its context of use. Although there exists different Data Quality models for assessing the quality of regular data, none of them has been adapted to Big Data. To fill this gap, we propose the "3As Data Quality-in-Use model", which is composed of three Data Quality characteristics for assessing the levels of Data Quality-in-Use in Big Data projects: Contextual Adequacy, Operational Adequacy and Temporal Adequacy. The model can be integrated into any sort of Big Data project, as it is independent of any pre-conditions or technologies. The paper shows the way to use the model with a working example. The model accomplishes every challenge related to Data Quality program aimed for Big Data. The main conclusion is that the model can be used as an appropriate way to obtain the Quality-in-Use levels of the input data of the Big Data analysis, and those levels can be understood as indicators of trustworthiness and soundness of the results of the Big Data analysis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The two main plasmodial species in French Guiana are Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum whose respective prevalence influences the frequency of mixed plasmodial infections. The accuracy of their diagnosis is influenced by the sensitivity of the method used, whereas neither microscopy nor rapid diagnostic tests allow a satisfactory evaluation of mixed plasmodial infections. METHODS: In the present study, the frequency of mixed infections in different part of French Guiana was determined using real time PCR, a sensitive and specific technique. RESULTS: From 400 cases of malaria initially diagnosed by microscopy, real time PCR showed that 10.75 {\%} of the cases were mixed infections. Their prevalence varied considerably between geographical areas. The presence, in equivalent proportions, of the two plasmodial species in eastern French Guiana was associated with a much higher prevalence of mixed plasmodial infections than in western French Guiana, where the majority of the population was Duffy negative and thus resistant to vivax malaria. CONCLUSION: Clinicians must be more vigilant regarding mixed infections in co-endemic P. falciparum/P. vivax areas, in order to deliver optimal care for patients suffering from malaria. This may involve the use of rapid diagnostic tests capable of detecting mixed infections or low density single infections. This is important as French Guiana moves towards malaria elimination.},

abstract = {Systemic autoimmune diseases (SAD) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, although their epidemiological profile varies significantly country by country. We explored the potential of the Google search engine to collect and merge large series ({\textgreater}1,000 patients) of SAD reported in the Pubmed library, with the aim of obtaining a high-definition geoepidemiological picture of each disease. We collected data from 394,827 patients with SAD. Analysis showed a predominance of medical vs. administrative databases (74{\%} vs. 26{\%}), public health system vs. health insurance resources (88{\%} vs. 12{\%}) and patient-based vs. population-based designs (82{\%} vs. 18{\%}). The most unbalanced gender ratio was found in primary Sj{\"{o}}gren syndrome (pSS), with nearly 10 females affected per 1 male, followed by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) (ratio of nearly 5:1). Each disease predominantly affects a specific age group: children (Kawasaki disease, primary immunodefficiencies and Schonlein-Henoch disease), young people (SLE Beh{\c{c}}et disease and sarcoidosis), middle-aged people (SSc, vasculitis and pSS) and the elderly (amyloidosis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and giant cell arteritis). We found significant differences in the geographical distribution of studies for each disease, and a higher frequency of the three SAD with available data (SLE, inflammatory myopathies and Kawasaki disease) in African-American patients. Using a “big data” approach enabled hitherto unseen connections in SAD to emerge.},

abstract = {This study reports the results of an empirical analysis of the Kuznets curve relationship between non-fatal road injuries and per-capita income. This relationship indicates that the number of road deaths increases with increasing per-capita income at lower income levels, but decreases once it has exceeded a threshold level. We apply a fixed effects negative binomial regression analysis on a panel of 90 countries over the period of 1963–2009. Results indicated evidence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between economic growth and non-fatal road injuries for both less developed and highly developed countries. Results also indicated that the turning point is higher in less developed countries than in higher developed countries. The evidence presented in this study suggests that improvements in road infrastructure, the quality of regulatory institutions, and increase in the use of safer transport modes will help reduce non-fatal road injuries.},

The ubiquitous availability of data, software, and cheap, high-powered, computing when coupled with the broad acceptance of the ideas in Tukey's 1977 treatise on exploratory data analysis has yielded a fundamental change in the way that the role of statistical graphics is thought of within science-as a dynamic partner and guide to the future rather than as a static monument to the discoveries of the past.

Although the evidence base on which these estimates are made remains somewhat precarious in view of the limited data systems in most low- and middle-income countries, these projections highlight the essential need to address road traffic injuries as a public health priority. Most well-evaluated effective interventions do not focus directly on efforts to protect vulnerable road users, such as motorcyclists and pedestrians. However, these groups comprise the majority of road traffic victims in low- and middle-income countries, and consequently the majority of road traffic victims globally. Responding appropriately to the disparities in available evidence and prevention efforts is necessary in order to address this global public health crisis comprehensively.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility of classifying emergency department patients into severity grades using data mining methods.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: Emergency department records of 402 patients were classified into five severity grades by two expert physicians. The Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes and C4.5 algorithms were applied to produce classifiers from patient data into severity grades. The classifiers' results over several subsets of the data were compared with the physicians' assessments, with a random classifier, and with a classifier that selects the maximal-prevalence class.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMEASUREMENTS: Positive predictive value, multiple-class extensions of sensitivity and specificity combinations, and entropy change.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The mean accuracy of the data mining classifiers was 52.94 ± 5.89{\%}, significantly better (P {\textless} 0.05) than the mean accuracy of a random classifier (34.60 ± 2.40{\%}). The entropy of the input data sets was reduced through classification by a mean of 10.1{\%}. Allowing for classification deviations of one severity grade led to mean accuracy of 85.42 ± 1.42{\%}. The classifiers' accuracy in that case was similar to the physicians' consensus rate. Learning from consensus records led to better performance. Reducing the number of severity grades improved results in certain cases. The performance of the Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes and C4.5 algorithms was similar; in unbalanced data sets, Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes performed better.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: It is possible to produce a computerized classification model for the severity grade of triage patients, using data mining methods. Learning from patient records regarding which there is a consensus of several physicians is preferable to learning from each physician's patients. Either Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes or C4.5 can be used; Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes is preferable for unbalanced data sets. An ambiguity in the intermediate severity grades seems to hamper both the physicians' agreement and the classifiers' accuracy.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate the association between fast-food restaurant density and adult body mass index (BMI) in Canada. Methods: Individual-level BMI and confounding variables were obtained from the 2007-2008 Canadian Community Health Survey master file. Locations of the fast-food and full-service chain restaurants and other non-chain restaurants were obtained from the 2008 Infogroup Canada business database. Food outlet density (fast-food, full-service and other) per 10,000 population was calculated for each Forward Sortation Area (FSA). Global (Moran's I) and local indicators of spatial autocorrelation of BMI were assessed. Ordinary least squares (OLS) and spatial auto-regressive error (SARE) methods were used to assess the association between local food environment and adult BMI in Canada. Results: Global and local spatial autocorrelation of BMI were found in our univariate analysis. We found that OLS and SARE estimates were very similar in our multivariate models. An additional fast-food restaurant per 10,000 people at the FSA-level is associated with a 0.022kg/m2 increase in BMI. On the other hand, other restaurant density is negatively related to BMI. Conclusions: Fast-food restaurant density is positively associated with BMI in Canada. Results suggest that restricting availability of fast-food in local neighborhoods may play a role in obesity prevention. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

This segregation shows Latin America's longstanding economic and social inequality, cemented by an economic framework that predicted that economic growth would lead to rapid formalisation of the economy. Today, the institutional setup that organises the social segregation in health care is perceived, despite improved life expectancy and other advances, as a barrier to fulfilling the right to health, embodied in the legislation of many Latin American countries. This Series paper outlines four phases in the history of Latin American countries that explain the roots of segmentation in health care and describe three paths taken by countries seeking to overcome it: unification of the funds used to finance both social security and Ministry of Health services (one public payer); free choice of provider or insurer; and expansion of services to poor people and the non-salaried population by making explicit the health-care benefits to which all citizens are entitled.},

Such support is difficult to design because solutions must address both the specifics of their scenario as well as the general issues of comparison. This paper aids designers by providing a strategy for considering those general issues. It presents four considerations that abstract comparison. These considerations identify issues and categorize solutions in a domain independent manner. The first considers how the common elements of comparison-a target set of items that are related and an action the user wants to perform on that relationship-are present in an analysis problem. The second considers why these elements lead to challenges because of their scale, in number of items, complexity of items, or complexity of relationship. The third considers what strategies address the identified scaling challenges, grouping solutions into three broad categories. The fourth considers which visual designs map to these strategies to provide solutions for a comparison analysis problem. In sequence, these considerations provide a process for developers to consider support for comparison in the design of visualization tools. Case studies show how these considerations can help in the design and evaluation of visualization solutions for comparison problems.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, the number of homicides in Porto Alegre has increased to the point where external causes are now the main group of causes of death in the 5-34-year age group. Preventing these deaths depends fundamentally on identifying factors related to excess violence in population groups. The overall aim of this study is to analyse the spatial distribution of homicide victims by place of residence in Porto Alegre, the capital of the southernmost Brazilian State of Rio Grande do Sul, in 1996, in order to identify and understand the socio-spatial context. Demographic and socioeconomic indicators based on the 1991 census and 1996 population count were used to build a multivariate classification characterizing the 1851 census tracts. Homicides occurring in 1996 were located using the municipality's Geographic Information System. Four socioeconomic groups were identified, mainly differentiated by housing indicators. Small areas on the urban periphery in which slums (favelas) are concentrated presented higher homicide rates. Homicide rates were lower in the two groups with higher income and educational level. The second step was to classify the census tracts according to the homicide indicator. In this case, areas were differentiated by the number of household inhabitants per room, income, schooling, and median age. We conclude that the multivariate socioeconomic classification presents a limited capacity to identify populations exposed to homicides, suggesting that socioeconomic conditions themselves do not determine violent behaviour. On the other hand, the spatial methods allowed us to identify small areas where deaths are concentrated and whose populations should receive special attention in planning measures to prevent violent deaths. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {TheEncyclopedia of Social Network Analysis and Mining (ESNAM) is the first major reference work to integrate fundamental concepts and research directions in the areas of social networks and applications to data mining. This set of comprehensive and authoritative volumes • explains the science and technology behind the rapidly growing global avenues for exchanging views and influencing others • presents the first comprehensive coverage of all fields that contribute to social network construction and analysis as a multidisciplinary domain • is designed to appeal to an interdisciplinary audience ranging from the undergraduate to professional level • describes social network applications to knowledge mining and discovery • addresses privacy, security, ethical, and civil liberty issues for social networks. While ESNAM reflects the state-of-the-art in social network research, the field had its start in the 1930s when fundamental issues in social network research were broadly defined. These communities were limited to relatively small numbers of nodes (actors) and links. More recently the advent of electronic communication, and in particular on-line communities, have created social networks of hitherto unimaginable sizes. People around the world are directly or indirectly connected by popular social networks established using web-based platforms rather than by physical proximity. Reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of this unique field, the essential contributions of diverse disciplines, from computer science, mathematics, and statistics to sociology and behavioral science, are described among the 300 authoritative yet highly readable entries. Students will find a world of information and insight behind the familiar fa{\c{c}}ade of the social networks in which they participate. Researchers and practitioners will benefit from a comprehensive perspective on the methodologies for analysis of constructed networks, and the data mining and machine learning techniques that have proved attractive for sophisticated knowledge discovery in complex applications. Also addressed is the application of social network methodologies to other domains, such as web networks and biological networks.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endemic malaria in Thailand continues to only exist along international borders. This pattern is frequently attributed to importation of malaria from surrounding nations. A microgeographical approach was used to investigate malaria cases in a study village along the Thailand-Myanmar border.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Three mass blood surveys were conducted during the study period (July and December 2011, and May 2012) and were matched to a cohort-based demographic surveillance system. Blood slides and filter papers were taken from each participant. Slides were cross-verified by an expert microscopist and filter papers were analysed using nested PCR. Cases were then mapped to households and analysed using spatial statistics. A risk factor analysis was done using mixed effects logistic regression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In total, 55 Plasmodium vivax and 20 Plasmodium falciparum cases (out of 547 participants) were detected through PCR, compared to six and two (respectively) cases detected by field microscopy. The single largest risk factor for infection was citizenship. Many study participants were ethnic Karen people with no citizenship in either Thailand or Myanmar. This subpopulation had over eight times the odds of malaria infection when compared to Thai citizens. Cases also appeared to cluster near a major drainage system and year-round water source within the study village.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This research indicates that many cases of malaria remain undiagnosed in the region. The spatial and demographic clustering of cases in a sub-group of the population indicates either transmission within the Thai village or shared exposure to malaria vectors outside of the village. While it is possible that malaria is imported to Thailand from Myanmar, the existence of undetected infections, coupled with an ecological setting that is conducive to malaria transmission, means that indigenous transmission could also occur on the Thai side of the border. Improved, timely, and active case detection is warranted.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study describes epidemiologic patterns of mortality due to suicide, homicide, and war for the world in order to serve as a benchmark against which to measure future progress and to raise awareness about violence as a global public health problem. SETTING: The world and its eight major regions. METHOD: Data were derived from The Global Burden of Disease series and the US National Center for Health Statistics to estimate crude rates, age adjusted rates, sex rate ratios, and the health burden for suicide, homicide, and war related deaths for the world and its eight major regions in 1990. RESULTS: In 1990, an estimated 1,851,000 people died from violence (35.3 per 100,000) in the world. There were an estimated 786,000 suicides. Overall suicide rates ranged from 3.4 per 100,000 in Sub-Saharan Africa to 30.4 per 100,000 in China. There were an estimated 563,000 homicides. Overall homicide rates ranged from 1.0 per 100,000 in established market economies to 44.8 per 100,000 in Sub-Saharan Africa with peaks among males aged 15-24 years old, and among females aged 0-4 years old. There were an estimated 502,000 war related deaths with peaks in rates for both sexes among people aged 0-4, 15-29, and 60-69 years old. CONCLUSION: The number of violence related deaths in the world is unacceptably high. Coordinated prevention and control efforts are urgently needed.},

Ultrasound examinations in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters demonstrated severe microcephaly, hydranencephaly, intracranial calcifications and destructive lesions of posterior fossa, in addition to hydrothorax, ascites and subcutaneous edema. An induced labor was performed at the 32nd gestational week due to fetal demise and delivered a female fetus. ZIKV-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction amplification products were obtained from extracts of cerebral cortex, medulla oblongata and cerebrospinal and amniotic fluid, while extracts of heart, lung, liver, vitreous body of the eye and placenta did not yield detectable products.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This case report provides evidence that in addition to microcephaly, there may be a link between Zika virus infection and hydrops fetalis and fetal demise.

abstract = {Despite its demonstrated effectiveness, colorectal cancer (CRC) testing is suboptimal, particularly in vulnerable populations such as those who are publicly insured. Prior studies provide an incomplete picture of the importance of the intersection of multilevel factors affecting CRC testing across heterogeneous geographic regions where vulnerable populations live. We examined CRC testing across regions of North Carolina by using population-based Medicare and Medicaid claims data from disabled individuals who turned 50 years of age during 2003-2008. We estimated multilevel models to examine predictors of CRC testing, including distance to the nearest endoscopy facility, county-level endoscopy procedural rates, and demographic and community contextual factors. Less than 50{\%} of eligible individuals had evidence of CRC testing; men, African-Americans, Medicaid beneficiaries, and those living furthest away from endoscopy facilities had significantly lower odds of CRC testing, with significant regional variation. These results can help prioritize intervention strategies to improve CRC testing among publicly insured, disabled populations. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Violence is an important aspect of competition in illicit markets because disputes cannot be resolved in the courts. A model of spatial competition suggests higher drug enforcement in one jurisdiction will increase the size of the drug market in an adjoining jurisdiction, resulting in a higher violent crime rate. Data from Florida jurisdictions suggest that geographic spillovers of violent crime result from law enforcement differentials and imply that they are much larger than those found in studies of property crime.},

abstract = {Studies in Sweden have raised doubts as to the accuracy of road accident statistics in relation to serious and slight injuries. To explore the reliability of British statistics an analysis has been made of a sample of 1200 patients injured in road accidents and attending hospital. These same cases have been traced in the police records on which official statistics are based. All fatal cases were correctly notified but two types of discrepancy occurred among injuries. In a small number of cases re-classification of “serious” and “slight” seemed to be required. A more important discrepancy was that about one-sixth of serious injuries and one third of slight injuries known to the hospital did not appear in the police notifications. This is not surprising in view of the limited scope of compulsory notification. The police mostly know of accidents by the calling of an ambulance or as a result of allegations of traffic infringements. Thus many cases where an ambulance is not called or in which a driver only is injured and no other vehicle is involved, escape notification. Injuries to pedal cyclists are particularly poorly notified. Less than one quarter of those known to the hospital appeared in the official statistics. It is concluded that similar comparisons of hospital and police information should be made elsewhere to confirm whether this sample is representative of the national rate of notification. In the meantime it is suggested that figures for injuries to pedal cyclists and for slight injuries in general should be used with caution. Des {\'{e}}tudes men{\'{e}}es en Su{\`{e}}de ont soulev{\'{e}} certains doutes sur la pr{\'{e}}cision de statistiques d'accidents routiers en ce qui concerne les blessures graves et l{\'{e}}g{\`{e}}res. Afin d'explorer la validit{\'{e}} des statistiques anglaises, une analyse a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} faite d'un {\'{e}}chantillon de 1200 malades bless{\'{e}}s sur la route et hospitalis{\'{e}}s. Ces m{\^{e}}mes cas ont {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} relev{\'{e}}s par la police dont les statistiques officielles ont {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} utilis{\'{e}}es. Tous les cas fatals ont {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} correctement notifi{\'{e}}s mais deux genres d'erreurs existent parmi les blessures. Dans un faible nombre de cas une re-classification entre blessures “s{\'{e}}rieuses” et “l{\'{e}}g{\`{e}}res” semble {\^{e}}tre n{\'{e}}cessaire. Une erreur plus importante est qu'un sixi{\`{e}}me environ de blessures s{\'{e}}rieuses et un tiers de celles l{\'{e}}g{\`{e}}res connues de l'hopital n'ont pas {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} enregistr{\'{e}}es {\`{a}} la police. Ceci n'est pas {\'{e}}tonnant du fait que la notification n'est pas toujours obligatoire. La police apprend le plus souvent l'existence d'un accident du fait de l'appel d'une ambulance ou d'une all{\'{e}}gation d'infracture de code. Par cons{\'{e}}quent, dans les cas o{\`{u}} une ambulance n'est pas appel{\'{e}}e ou l{\`{a}} o{\`{u}} un seul chauffeur est impliqu{\'{e}}, aucune notification n'est apport{\'{e}}e. Les accidents de cyclistes en particulier sont rarement notifi{\'{e}}s. Moins du quart de ceux connus {\`{a}} l'hopital ne paraissent dans les statistiques officielles. Il est conclu que des comparaisons semblables de renseignements des hopitaux et de la police devraient {\^{e}}tre faites ailleurs pour confirmer la valeur repr{\'{e}}sentative de cet {\'{e}}chantillon sur le taux national de notification. Entretemps, il est sugg{\'{e}}r{\'{e}} que les chiffres des blessures aux cyclistes et des blessures l{\'{e}}g{\`{e}}res en g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}ral devraient {\^{e}}tre utilis{\'{e}}es avec soin. Untersuchungen in Schweden gaben zu Zweifeln {\"{u}}ber die Genauigkeit von Statistiken {\"{u}}ber Strassenunf{\"{a}}lle in Bezug auf leichte und schwere Verletzungen Anlass. Zur Ermittlung der Zuverl{\"{a}}ssigkeit britischer Statistiken ist eine Analyse aus einer Probe von 1200 Patienten gemacht worden, welche in Strassenunf{\"{a}}llen verletzt wurden und Aufenthalt im Krankenhaus hatten. Die gleichen F{\"{a}}lle sind in den Polizeiberichten nachgepr{\"{u}}ft worden, auf welche sich offizielle Statistiken gr{\"{u}}nden. Alle t{\"{o}}tlichen F{\"{a}}lle wurden korrekt bekannt gegeben, aber unter den Verletzungen kamen zwei Arten von Widerspr{\"{u}}chen vor. In einer kleinen Anzahl von F{\"{a}}llen schien es n{\"{o}}tig, “schwer” und “leicht” neu klassifizieren zu m{\"{u}}ssen. Ein wichtigerer Widerspruch lag darin, da{\ss} etwa ein Sechstel der, dem Krankenhaus bekannten schweren Verletzungen und ein Drittel der leichten Verletzungen nicht in den Polizeiberichten erschienen. Dies ist in Anbetracht des begrenzten Bereichs eines Zwangs der Berichterstattung nicht {\"{u}}berraschend. Die Polizei erf{\"{a}}hrt Unf{\"{a}}lle durch Ruf von Krankenwagen oder infolge von Verletzungen der Verkehrsvorschriften. Somit wird in vielen F{\"{a}}llen, in denen kein Krankenwagen gerufen wird oder nur ein Fahrer verletzt wird, und kein anderes Fahrzeug verwickelt ist, Bekanntmachung vermieden. Verletzungen von Radfahrern werden insbesondere selten bekannt gegeben. Weniger als ein Viertel der, den Krankenh{\"{a}}usern bekannten F{\"{a}}lle erschienen in der offiziellen Statistik.

Understanding how all-cause mortality has changed with respect to development status can identify exemplars for best practice. To accomplish this, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) estimated age-specific and sex-specific all-cause mortality between 1970 and 2016 for 195 countries and territories and at the subnational level for the five countries with a population greater than 200 million in 2016.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We have evaluated how well civil registration systems captured deaths using a set of demographic methods called death distribution methods for adults and from consideration of survey and census data for children younger than 5 years. We generated an overall assessment of completeness of registration of deaths by dividing registered deaths in each location-year by our estimate of all-age deaths generated from our overall estimation process. For 163 locations, including subnational units in countries with a population greater than 200 million with complete vital registration (VR) systems, our estimates were largely driven by the observed data, with corrections for small fluctuations in numbers and estimation for recent years where there were lags in data reporting (lags were variable by location, generally between 1 year and 6 years). For other locations, we took advantage of different data sources available to measure under-5 mortality rates (U5MR) using complete birth histories, summary birth histories, and incomplete VR with adjustments; we measured adult mortality rate (the probability of death in individuals aged 15–60 years) using adjusted incomplete VR, sibling histories, and household death recall. We used the U5MR and adult mortality rate, together with crude death rate due to HIV in the GBD model life table system, to estimate age-specific and sex-specific death rates for each location-year. Using various international databases, we identified fatal discontinuities, which we defined as increases in the death rate of more than one death per million, resulting from conflict and terrorism, natural disasters, major transport or technological accidents, and a subset of epidemic infectious diseases; these were added to estimates in the relevant years. In 47 countries with an identified peak adult prevalence for HIV/AIDS of more than 0{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} and where VR systems were less than 65{\%} complete, we informed our estimates of age-sex-specific mortality using the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP)-Spectrum model fitted to national HIV/AIDS prevalence surveys and antenatal clinic serosurveillance systems. We estimated stillbirths, early neonatal, late neonatal, and childhood mortality using both survey and VR data in spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models. We estimated abridged life tables for all location-years using age-specific death rates. We grouped locations into development quintiles based on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and analysed mortality trends by quintile. Using spline regression, we estimated the expected mortality rate for each age-sex group as a function of SDI. We identified countries with higher life expectancy than expected by comparing observed life expectancy to anticipated life expectancy on the basis of development status alone.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Completeness in the registration of deaths increased from 28{\%} in 1970 to a peak of 45{\%} in 2013; completeness was lower after 2013 because of lags in reporting. Total deaths in children younger than 5 years decreased from 1970 to 2016, and slower decreases occurred at ages 5–24 years. By contrast, numbers of adult deaths increased in each 5-year age bracket above the age of 25 years. The distribution of annualised rates of change in age-specific mortality rate differed over the period 2000 to 2016 compared with earlier decades: increasing annualised rates of change were less frequent, although rising annualised rates of change still occurred in some locations, particularly for adolescent and younger adult age groups. Rates of stillbirths and under-5 mortality both decreased globally from 1970. Evidence for global convergence of death rates was mixed; although the absolute difference between age-standardised death rates narrowed between countries at the lowest and highest levels of SDI, the ratio of these death rates—a measure of relative inequality—increased slightly. There was a strong shift between 1970 and 2016 toward higher life expectancy, most noticeably at higher levels of SDI. Among countries with populations greater than 1 million in 2016, life expectancy at birth was highest for women in Japan, at 86{\textperiodcentered}9 years (95{\%} UI 86{\textperiodcentered}7–87{\textperiodcentered}2), and for men in Singapore, at 81{\textperiodcentered}3 years (78{\textperiodcentered}8–83{\textperiodcentered}7) in 2016. Male life expectancy was generally lower than female life expectancy between 1970 and 2016, and the gap between male and female life expectancy increased with progression to higher levels of SDI. Some countries with exceptional health performance in 1990 in terms of the difference in observed to expected life expectancy at birth had slower progress on the same measure in 2016.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Globally, mortality rates have decreased across all age groups over the past five decades, with the largest improvements occurring among children younger than 5 years. However, at the national level, considerable heterogeneity remains in terms of both level and rate of changes in age-specific mortality; increases in mortality for certain age groups occurred in some locations. We found evidence that the absolute gap between countries in age-specific death rates has declined, although the relative gap for some age-sex groups increased. Countries that now lead in terms of having higher observed life expectancy than that expected on the basis of development alone, or locations that have either increased this advantage or rapidly decreased the deficit from expected levels, could provide insight into the means to accelerate progress in nations where progress has stalled.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Funding{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Bill {\&} Melinda Gates Foundation, and the National Institute on Aging and the National Institute of Mental Health of the National Institutes of Health.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{El-Sayed2012,
abstract = {The past five years have seen a growth in the interest in systems approaches in epidemiologic research. These approaches may be particularly appropriate for social epidemiology. Social network analysis and agent-based models (ABMs) are two approaches that have been used in the epidemiologic literature. Social network analysis involves the characterization of social networks to yield inference about how network structures may influence risk exposures among those in the network. ABMs can promote population-level inference from explicitly programmed, micro-level rules in simulated populations over time and space. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of these models in social epidemiologic research, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Network analysis may be ideal for understanding social contagion, as well as the influences of social interaction on population health. However, network analysis requires network data, which may sacrifice generalizability, and causal inference from current network analytic methods is limited. ABMs are uniquely suited for the assessment of health determinants at multiple levels of influence that may couple with social interaction to produce population health. ABMs allow for the exploration of feedback and reciprocity between exposures and outcomes in the etiology of complex diseases. They may also provide the opportunity for counterfactual simulation. However, appropriate implementation of ABMs requires a balance between mechanistic rigor and model parsimony, and the precision of output from complex models is limited. Social network and agent-based approaches are promising in social epidemiology, but continued development of each approach is needed.},

abstract = {The Council on Health Research for Development (COHRED) supports countries to optimise their health research potential to improve health and reduce health inequities and to generate economic and social prosperity. COHRED prioritises the poorest countries/regions/populations. It achieves its mission by providing support (processes, methods, technical information, learning opportunities, advocacy, motivation, seed-funds) which countries can use to develop their own health research systems and partnerships to pursue high quality research focused on priorities for advancement in health as identified by them. Research should take place in and help build National Health Research Systems (NHRS). These systems should ensure optimal governance of research, human and financial resource management, and research production and utilisation. Priority setting and developing the capability for priority setting are minimum requirements for a research system to function well. Since 1993, COHRED has published working papers, studies and a set of criteria to help guide priority setting at national level, and supported some 25 countries in developing national priority setting processes. Although many organisations in health research, science and technology and other sectors have developed methods and tools for priority setting in health and for research, scarce information is available on the best processes to ensure priority setting for national health research is sustainable, remains up to date, and leads to relevant actions. The COHRED Priority Setting Initiative works with institutions, development and health research partners to find and share practical solutions to priority setting. This Working Paper is the first step in a ‘learning spiral' that engages research managers and institutions to share experiences. From these interactions, a process and approach will be distilled that people, institutions and other development partners can use or adapt to make priority- setting work for their countries.},

abstract = {With the development of computer technology, there is a tremendous increase in the growth of data. Scientists are overwhelmed with this increasing amount of data processing needs which is getting arisen from every science field. A big problem has been encountered in various fields for making the full use of these large scale data which support decision making. Data mining is the technique that can discovers new patterns from large data sets. For many years it has been studied in all kinds of application area and thus many data mining methods have been developed and applied to practice. But there was a tremendous increase in the amount of data, their computation and analyses in recent years. In such situation most classical data mining methods became out of reach in practice to handle such big data. Efficient parallel/concurrent algorithms and implementation techniques are the key to meeting the scalability and performance requirements entailed in such large scale data mining analyses. Number of parallel algorithms has been implemented by making the use of different parallelization techniques which can be listed as: threads, MPI, MapReduce, and mash-up or workflow technologies that yields different performance and usability characteristics. MPI model is found to be efficient in computing the rigorous problems, especially in simulation. But it is not easy to be used in real. MapReduce is developed from the data analysis model of the information retrieval field and is a cloud technology. Till now, several MapReduce architectures has been developed for handling the big data. The most famous is the Google. The other one having such features is Hadoop which is the most popular open source MapReduce software adopted by many huge IT companies, such as Yahoo, Facebook, eBay and so on. In this paper, we focus specifically on Hadoop and its implementation of MapReduce for analytical processing.},

abstract = {The number of traffic fatalities reached a peak in many highly motorised countries around 1970. Some previous studies have suggested that the turning point in the number of traffic fatalities was inevitable and did not reflect a change in the underlying trends influencing the number of traffic fatalities. Other studies suggest that trends in traffic growth and fatality rate changed from before to after the turning point. This paper proposes two hypotheses about the turning point in the number of traffic fatalities. One hypothesis is that the long-term trends in traffic growth and fatality rate were the same before and after the turning point. The other hypothesis is that the long-term trends in traffic growth and fatality rate were different before and after the turning point was reached, in particular that the annual percentage decline in fatality rate became greater after the turning point than before. Such a change would suggest that road safety policy became more effective. Analysis of data for six countries (Denmark, Great Britain, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, United States) lends stronger support to the latter hypothesis than to the former. The lesson for policy makers, in particular in countries where the number of traffic fatalities is still growing, is that they should not expect a turning point to be reached without policy interventions.},

Conceitualmente, Omran, em 1971, focou a teoria da transi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o epidemiol{\'{o}}gica nas complexas mudan{\c{c}}as dos padr{\~{o}}es sa{\'{u}}de-doen{\c{c}}a e nas intera{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es entre esses padr{\~{o}}es, seus determinantes demogr{\'{a}}ficos, econ{\^{o}}micos e sociais, e suas consequ{\^{e}}ncias. 2 Entre as proposi{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es centrais inclu{\'{i}}das em sua teoria, destacam-se: (i) existe um processo longo de mudan{\c{c}}as nos padr{\~{o}}es de mortalidade e adoecimento, em que as pandemias por doen{\c{c}}as infecciosas s{\~{a}}o gradativamente substitu{\'{i}}das pelas doen{\c{c}}as degenerativas e agravos produzidos pelo homem*; (ii) durante essa transi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, as mais profundas mudan{\c{c}}as nos padr{\~{o}}es de sa{\'{u}}de-doen{\c{c}}a ocorrem nas crian{\c{c}}as e nas mulheres jovens; (iii) as mudan{\c{c}}as que caracterizam a transi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o epidemiol{\'{o}}gica s{\~{a}}o fortemente associadas {\`{a}}s transi{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es demogr{\'{a}}fica e socioecon{\^{o}}mica que constituem o complexo da moderniza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o; e (iv) as varia{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es peculiares no padr{\~{a}}o, no ritmo, nos determinantes e nas consequ{\^{e}}ncias das mudan{\c{c}}as na popula{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o diferenciam tr{\^{e}}s modelos b{\'{a}}sicos de transi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o epidemiol{\'{o}}gica, o modelo cl{\'{a}}ssico ou ocidental, o modelo acelerado e o modelo contempor{\^{a}}neo ou prolongado. 2 Vinte anos mais tarde, Frenk e colaboradores defendem a exist{\^{e}}ncia de um modelo 'polarizado prolongado' de transi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o epidemiol{\'{o}}gica na Am{\'{e}}rica Latina, caracterizado por: 3 (i) superposi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de etapas – incid{\^{e}}ncia alta e concomitante das doen{\c{c}}as de ambas as etapas, pr{\'{e}} e p{\'{o}}s-transi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o –; (ii) contra-transi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o – ressurgimento de algumas doen{\c{c}}as infecciosas que j{\'{a}} haviam sido controladas –; (iii) transi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o prolongada – processos de transi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o inconclusos, com certo estancamento dos pa{\'{i}}ses em estado de morbidade mista –; e (iv) polariza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o epidemio-l{\'{o}}gica – n{\'{i}}veis diferenciados de transi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o entre e intrapa{\'{i}}ses, inclusive entre grupos sociais de um mesmo pa{\'{i}}s.

Uma das primeiras revis{\~{o}}es de que se tem registro data de 1753, e foi feita por Sir James Lind sobre a preven{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o e o tratamento do escorbuto. 1 Por sua vez, a primeira soma estat{\'{i}}stica dos resultados de estudos, t{\'{e}}cnica hoje conhecida como metan{\'{a}}lise, foi publicada em 1904 pelo matem{\'{a}}tico Karl Pearson. 2 As revis{\~{o}}es que podemos considerar como sistem{\'{a}}ticas come{\c{c}}aram a aparecer na d{\'{e}}cada de 1950.

abstract = {Companies have realized they need to hire data scientists, academic institutions are scrambling to put together data-science programs, and publications are touting data science as a hot - even "sexy" - career choice. However, there is confusion about what exactly data science is, and this confusion could lead to disillusionment as the concept diffuses into meaningless buzz. In this article, we argue that there are good reasons why it has been hard to pin down exactly what is data science. One reason is that data science is intricately intertwined with other important concepts also of growing importance, such as big data and data-driven decision making. Another reason is the natural tendency to associate what a practitioner does with the definition of the practitioner's field; this can result in overlooking the fundamentals of the field. We believe that trying to define the boundaries of data science precisely is not of the utmost importance. We can debate the boundaries of the field in an academic setting, but in order for data science to serve business effectively, it is important (i) to understand its relationships to other important related concepts, and (ii) to begin to identify the fundamental principles underlying data science. Once we embrace (ii), we can much better understand and explain exactly what data science has to offer. Furthermore, only once we embrace (ii) should we be comfortable calling it data science. In this article, we present a perspective that addresses all these concepts. We close by offering, as examples, a partial list of fundamental principles underlying data science.},

abstract = {Despite the widespread and rapidly growing popularity of Big Data, researchers have yet to agree on what the concept entails, what tools are still needed to best interrogate these data, whether or not Big Data's emergence represents a new academic field or simply a set of tools, and how much confidence we can place on results derived from Big Data. Despite these ambiguities, most would agree that Big Data and the methods for analyzing it represent a remarkable potential for advancing social science knowledge. In my Presidential address to the Southern Demographic Association, I argue that demographers have long collected and analyzed Big Data in a small way, by parsing out the points of information that we can manipulate with familiar models and restricting analyses to what typical computing systems can handle or restricted-access data disseminators will allow. In order to better interrogate the data we already have, we need to change the culture of demography to treat demographic microdata as Big. This includes shaping the definition of Big Data, changing how we conceptualize models, and re-evaluating how we silo confidential data.},

@article{Kawachi1997,
abstract = {Ecologic studies in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world have demonstrated that income inequality is strongly related to mortality and life expectancy: the greater the dispersion of income within a given society, the lower the life expectancy. However, these empirical studies have been criticized on the grounds that the choice of indicator may have influenced positive findings. Using a cross-sectional, ecologic design, we tested the relationships of six different income inequality indicators to total mortality rates in the 50 U.S. states. The following summary measures of income distribution were examined: the Gini coefficient; the decile ratio; the proportions of total income earned by the bottom 50{\%}, 60{\%}, and 70{\%} of households; the Robin Hood Index; the Atkinson Index; and Theil's entropy measure. All were highly correlated with each other (Pearson r ≥ 0.94), and all were strongly associated with mortality (Pearson r ranging from 0.50 to 0.66), even after adjustment for median income and poverty. Thus, the choice of income distribution measure does not appear to alter the conclusion that income inequality is linked to higher mortality. Furthermore, adjustment for taxes and transfers, as well as household size (using equivalence scales), made no difference to the income inequality/mortality association. From a policy perspective, the alternative income distribution measures perform differently under varying types of income transfers, so that theoretical considerations should guide the selection of an indicator to assess the impact of social and economic policies that address income inequality.},

We sought to identify traces of possible clinical manifestations of nervous system diseases among the registers of hospital admissions recorded in the Brazilian Unified Health System. Time series of several diagnoses from the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, were analyzed by using control diagrams, during January 2008–February 2016. Beginning in mid-1914, we observed an unprecedented and significant rise in the hospitalization rate for congenital malformations of the nervous system, Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome, encephalitis, myelitis, and encephalomyelitis. These conditions are compatible with viral infection and inflammation-associated manifestations and may have been due to the entrance of Zika virus into Brazil. These findings show the necessity of adequately diagnosing and treating suspected cases of Zika virus infection and also that health surveillance systems can be improved by using routine data.},

Multiple sources of information and evidence have been collated including STATS19 road accident data, population data, socio-demographic data, economic patterns, weather trends and traffic and vehicle data. Summary analyses of these data sources show a reduction in overall traffic, a large reduction in HGV traffic, a reduction in young male drivers, a reduction in speeding, and a reduction in drink driving during the recession period. All of these reductions can be associated with a reduction in fatal accidents and have led to the conclusion that the economic recession changed behaviours in such a way that fewer people were killed on the roads in Britain during this period.},

A provincial analysis of its urbanisation trends shows shifting and accelerating rural-to-urban migration across the country and accompanying rapid increases in city size and population. The growing disease burden in urban areas attributable to nutrition and lifestyle choices is a major public health challenge, as are troubling disparities in health-care access, vaccination coverage, and accidents and injuries in China's rural-to-urban migrant population. Urban environmental quality, including air and water pollution, contributes to disease both in urban and in rural areas, and traffic-related accidents pose a major public health threat as the country becomes increasingly motorised. To address the health challenges and maximise the benefits that accompany this rapid urbanisation, innovative health policies focused on the needs of migrants and research that could close knowledge gaps on urban population exposures are needed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Annotated patient-provider encounters can provide important insights into clinical communication, ultimately suggesting how it might be improved to effect better health outcomes. But annotating outpatient transcripts with Roter or General Medical Interaction Analysis System (GMIAS) codes is expensive, limiting the scope of such analyses. We propose automatically annotating transcripts of patient-provider interactions with topic codes via machine learning. METHODS We use a conditional random field (CRF) to model utterance topic probabilities. The model accounts for the sequential structure of conversations and the words comprising utterances. We assess predictive performance via 10-fold cross-validation over GMIAS-annotated transcripts of 360 outpatient visits ({\textgreater}230,000 utterances). We then use automated in place of manual annotations to reproduce an analysis of 116 additional visits from a randomized trial that used GMIAS to assess the efficacy of an intervention aimed at improving communication around antiretroviral (ARV) adherence. RESULTS With respect to 6 topic codes, the CRF achieved a mean pairwise kappa compared with human annotators of 0.49 (range: 0.47-0.53) and a mean overall accuracy of 0.64 (range: 0.62-0.66). With respect to the RCT reanalysis, results using automated annotations agreed with those obtained using manual ones. According to the manual annotations, the median number of ARV-related utterances without and with the intervention was 49.5 versus 76, respectively (paired sign test P = 0.07). When automated annotations were used, the respective numbers were 39 versus 55 (P = 0.04). While moderately accurate, the predicted annotations are far from perfect. Conversational topics are intermediate outcomes, and their utility is still being researched. CONCLUSIONS This foray into automated topic inference suggests that machine learning methods can classify utterances comprising patient-provider interactions into clinically relevant topics with reasonable accuracy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The epidemiological profiles of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, are strongly associated with environmental conditions. An understanding of the effect of the climate on the occurrence of malaria may provide indirect insight into the anopheles mosquito vectors endemic to a particular region. The association between meteorological and hydrographical factors and the occurrence of malaria was studied in a village in French Guiana during an epidemic caused essentially by Plasmodium vivax.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A cohort of confirmed cases of P. vivax malaria occurring between 2002 and 2007 was studied to search for an association between the number of new infection episodes occurring each month, mean, maximum and minimum monthly temperatures, cumulative rainfall for the month and the mean monthly height of the river bordering the village, with the aid of time series. Cross-correlation analysis revealed that these meteorological factors had large effects on the number of episodes, over a study period of 12 months.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Climatic factors supporting the continuance of the epidemic were identified in the short-term (low minimum temperatures during the month), medium-term (low maximum temperatures two months before) and long-term (low maximum temperatures nine months before and high lowest level of the river 12 months before). Cross-correlation analysis showed that the effects of these factors were greatest at the beginning of the short rainy season.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The association between the river level and the number of malaria attacks provides clues to better understand the environment of malaria transmission and the ecological characteristics of the vectors in the region.},

abstract = {This study considers the vulnerability of the urban area of the City of Belo Horizonte to dengue. A total number of 89,607 cases registered in the surveillance system from 1996 to 2002 were analyzed. Seven epidemic waves were identified during this period. Cases were grouped into 2,563 census areas, and three risk categories were proposed based on how many times each area reached a threshold established for each epidemic wave. The association between the risk categories and the socioeconomic, demographic and urban-infrastructure characteristics was evaluated. Analysis included Kruskal–Wallis test variance comparisons and multivariate regression using multinomial models. Incidence rates differed significantly among the three risk categories in most of the epidemic waves. The factors that best characterized the areas were low educational level (≤4 years of schooling), low income of the head of the family (≤2 minimum wages per household), household density, and proportion of children and elderly women. Information related to basic sanitation was not enough to discriminate levels of susceptibility to dengue, and study of population density and concentration of establishments considered vulnerable to vector infestation yielded questionable results. It is important to consider different levels of exposure of the population to explain the heterogeneous pattern of distribution of dengue cases in an urban setting. Understanding the dynamics of dengue fever is essential for surveillance purposes, to improve control measures and to avoid epidemics of this disease.},

abstract = {Life, death, and disability in 2016 In this week's issue of The Lancet, we publish the latest global, regional, and national estimates and analyses from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016), covering the period 1990 to 2016. The GBD is a herculean effort that annually tracks disease burden across countries, time, age, and sex. In 2016, there were an estimated 128{\textperiodcentered}8 million livebirths and 54{\textperiodcentered}7 million deaths. The good news is that globally, mortality rates have decreased across all age groups over the past five decades. For the first time, the estimated number of deaths in children under 5 years fell below 5 million, and there were 230 000 maternal deaths. Deaths from communicable diseases have largely decreased apart from dengue, where deaths increased by 81{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} since 2006 to 37 800 in 2016. There were an estimated 1{\textperiodcentered}03 million HIV/AIDS deaths, 1{\textperiodcentered}2 million tuberculosis deaths, and 719 600 malaria deaths. However, an estimated 72{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} (39{\textperiodcentered}5 million) of all deaths in 2016 were from non-communicable diseases. Since 2006, deaths from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) have increased by 19{\%} globally. The Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) is a metric that measures a country's development. IHD is the leading cause of premature mortality in all SDI categories apart from the low SDI grouping. Diabetes caused 1{\textperiodcentered}43 million deaths in 2016, an increase of 31{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} since 2006. Levels of obesity continue to rise worldwide. Smoking and poor diet remain leading risk factors of ill health. Regrettably, the largest increase in deaths from injuries was from conflict and terrorism. Deaths from firearms were the largest proportion of overall interpersonal violence. Sadly, the prevalence of mental health conditions globally also shows little improvement since 1990. Indeed, major depressive disorders ranked in the top ten causes of ill health in all but four countries worldwide in 2016. Overall, the findings show that the world is becoming healthier, but progress is uneven. People are living longer, but with more disease. As SDI rises, the gap between healthy life expectancy and life expectancy (ie, the time living with ill health) is less for high SDI countries compared with low SDI countries. So, while there is an expansion of morbidity as life expectancy increases, there is a relative compression of morbidity (less time spent with ill health) as a country becomes richer. This year, each paper contains a vast amount of new data and analyses. The study showcases exemplar nations, such as Ethiopia, the Maldives, Nepal, Niger, Peru, and Portugal, where observed life expectancy was greater than expected life expectancy based on their SDIs. It will be important to learn the reasons for progress in these countries. In the first-year analysis of country progress towards meeting the health-related Sustainable Development Goals, no countries are projected to meet more than 13 of the 24 targets by 2030. Singapore, Iceland, and Sweden were the best performers in 2016 while Somalia, the Central African Republic, and Afghanistan were the poorest. In 2013, the core message from the Lancet Commission on Investing in Health (Global Health 2035) was that the world has a unique opportunity to end preventable mortality in a single generation. The report argued that a grand convergence in mortality and life expectancy, where rich and poor countries converge to being the same in 2035, is possible. But when one looks at the estimates from GBD 2016, the picture is mixed. There is some evidence of convergence in mortality. But in some areas, there has been a relative divergence—for example, in men and women aged 30–54 years. The Commission must review and reflect on these findings in its future work. One message from these papers is that there are certain health issues that need specific attention in different countries. These challenges will require strengthening of the health system, together with more vertical initiatives— universal health coverage alone will not suffice. There should be a global forum where these results and their policy implications are discussed. We propose that WHO, the World Bank, and other technical and multilateral agencies join together annually to discuss the GBD findings, and how they should influence decision making. Looking ahead, a key further task for GBD is how to incorporate one of the defining challenges of our times— threats to our planetary health—into their analyses. For example, the likely effects of climate change on the displacement of people will be substantial. Human beings also depend on a variety of ecosystem resources for their health and wellbeing. To recognise these new risks, the GBD will have to consider developing additional health-related metrics that relate to planetary health: such as concerning biodiversity, climate change, and ecosystem services. Therein lies a challenge for the next GBD. n The Lancet},

To some authors "access" refers to entry into or use of the health care system, while to others it characterizes factors influencing entry or use. The purpose of this article is to propose a taxonomic definition of "access." Access is presented here as a general concept that summarizes a set of more specific dimensions describing the fit between the patient and the health care system. The specific dimensions are availability, accessibility, accommodation, affordability and acceptability. Using interview data on patient satisfaction, the discriminant validity of these dimensions is investigated. Results provide strong support for the view that differentiation does exist among the five areas and that the measures do relate to the phenomena with which they are identified.},

One limitation is the lack of algorithmic solutions to combine local data sources for regional situation awareness. The objective of the current study is to develop and demonstrate the value of automated information fusion methods applied to the distributed neighboring public health sites. A prototype system consisting of distributed Bayesian models was designed to enable informed regional and local cognitive decision support response. The Intelligent Decision Support Network (IDSN) is composed of Bayesian Information Fusion Models (BIFMs) that target a particular syndrome or disease type. Using local data from county health departments in Northern Virginia for the time period between August 2005 and May 2007, we estimated the probability of a gastrointestinal (GI) outbreak in two ways: First, based on data from the local hospitals only; and second, based on the relative probability of outbreak by combining local hospital data and probabilities of GI events from the neighboring counties' BIFMs. Preliminary findings showed that the network of distributed models detected events that would be undetected without multi-jurisdictional data. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Every day thousands of people are killed and injured on our roads. Men, women or children walking, biking or riding to school or work, playing in the streets or setting out on long trips, will never return home, leaving behind shattered families and communities. Millions of people each year will spend long weeks in hospital after severe crashes and many will never be able to live, work or play as they used to do. Current efforts to address road safety are minimal in comparison to this growing human suffering. The World Health Organization and the World Bank have jointly produced this World report on road traffic injury prevention. Its purpose is to present a comprehensive overview of what is known about the magnitude, risk factors and impact of road traffic injuries, and about ways to prevent and lessen the impact of road crashes. The document is the outcome of a collaborative effort by institutions and individuals. Over 100 experts, from all continents and different sectors - including transport, engineering, health, police, education and civil society - have worked to produce the report.  Road traffic injuries are a growing public health issue, disproportionately affecting vulnerable groups of road users, including the poor. But road traffic crashes and injuries are preventable. Road traffic injury prevention must be incorporated into a broad range of activities, such as the development and management of road infrastructure, mobility planning, the provision of health and hospital services, child welfare services, and urban and environmental planning. The health sector is an important partner in this process. Its roles are to strengthen the evidence base, provide appropriate pre-hospital and hospital care and rehabilitation, conduct advocacy, and contribute to the implementation and evaluation of interventions. The time to act is now. Road safety is no accident. It requires strong political will and concerted, sustained efforts across a range of sectors. Acting now will save lives. },

abstract = {Abstract A spatial vector autoregressive model (SpVAR) is defined as a VAR which includes spatial as well as temporal lags among a vector of stationary state variables. SpVARs may contain disturbances that are spatially as well as temporally correlated. Although the structural parameters are not fully identified in SpVARs, contemporaneous spatial lag coefficients may be identified by weakly exogenous state variables. Dynamic spatial panel data econometrics is used to estimate SpVARs. The incidental parameter problem is handled by bias correction rather than more popular alternatives such as generalised methods of moments (GMM). The interaction between temporal and spatial stationarity is discussed. The impulse responses for SpVARs are derived, which naturally depend upon the temporal and spatial dynamics of the model. We provide an empirical illustration using annual spatial panel data for Israel. The estimated SpVAR is used to calculate impulse responses between variables, over time, and across space. Finally, weakly exogenous instrumental variables are used to identify contemporaneous spatial lag coefficients.

abstract = {Background Up-to-date evidence about levels and trends in disease and injury incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) is an essential input into global, regional, and national health policies. In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013), we estimated these quantities for acute and chronic diseases and injuries for 188 countries between 1990 and 2013. Methods Estimates were calculated for disease and injury incidence, prevalence, and YLDs using GBD 2010 methods with some important refinements. Results for incidence of acute disorders and prevalence of chronic disorders are new additions to the analysis. Key improvements include expansion to the cause and sequelae list, updated systematic reviews, use of detailed injury codes, improvements to the Bayesian meta-regression method (DisMod-MR), and use of severity splits for various causes. An index of data representativeness, showing data availability, was calculated for each cause and impairment during three periods globally and at the country level for 2013. In total, 35 620 distinct sources of data were used and documented to calculated estimates for 301 diseases and injuries and 2337 sequelae. The comorbidity simulation provides estimates for the number of sequelae, concurrently, by individuals by country, year, age, and sex. Disability weights were updated with the addition of new population-based survey data from four countries. Findings Disease and injury were highly prevalent; only a small fraction of individuals had no sequelae. Comorbidity rose substantially with age and in absolute terms from 1990 to 2013. Incidence of acute sequelae were predominantly infectious diseases and short-term injuries, with over 2 billion cases of upper respiratory infections and diarrhoeal disease episodes in 2013, with the notable exception of tooth pain due to permanent caries with more than 200 million incident cases in 2013. Conversely, leading chronic sequelae were largely attributable to non-communicable diseases, with prevalence estimates for asymptomatic permanent caries and tension-type headache of 2??4 billion and 1??6 billion, respectively. The distribution of the number of sequelae in populations varied widely across regions, with an expected relation between age and disease prevalence. YLDs for both sexes increased from 537??6 million in 1990 to 764??8 million in 2013 due to population growth and ageing, whereas the age-standardised rate decreased little from 114??87 per 1000 people to 110??31 per 1000 people between 1990 and 2013. Leading causes of YLDs included low back pain and major depressive disorder among the top ten causes of YLDs in every country. YLD rates per person, by major cause groups, indicated the main drivers of increases were due to musculoskeletal, mental, and substance use disorders, neurological disorders, and chronic respiratory diseases; however HIV/AIDS was a notable driver of increasing YLDs in sub-Saharan Africa. Also, the proportion of disability-adjusted life years due to YLDs increased globally from 21??1{\%} in 1990 to 31??2{\%} in 2013. Interpretation Ageing of the world's population is leading to a substantial increase in the numbers of individuals with sequelae of diseases and injuries. Rates of YLDs are declining much more slowly than mortality rates. The non-fatal dimensions of disease and injury will require more and more attention from health systems. The transition to non-fatal outcomes as the dominant source of burden of disease is occurring rapidly outside of sub-Saharan Africa. Our results can guide future health initiatives through examination of epidemiological trends and a better understanding of variation across countries.},

This study performs a series of Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the total error due to bias and variance in the inferences of each model, for typical sizes and types of datasets encountered in applied research. The results offer a typology of dataset characteristics to help researchers choose a preferred model.},

Using the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), we confirmed previous state-based studies showing that high income and education levels have a protective influence on alcohol-related fatal motor vehicle crashes. We also confirmed that language proficiency/acculturation tends to increase the vulnerability of Hispanic women to alcohol-related fatalities. Differences in alcohol-related fatality rates across Hispanic subgroups are observed. Future reductions in alcohol-related traffic fatalities may require prevention policies that take into account existent variations in acculturation, income, and education among racial/ethnic groups and subgroups.},

abstract = {Increases in international funding for health have been accompanied by accelerating demand for more and better statistics, which are needed to track performance and ensure accountability. Worldwide interest in the monitoring of development, as exemplified in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), generates pressure for high-quality and timely data for reporting on country progress. This rapid escalation of demand has exposed major gaps in the supply of health statistics for developing countries but also provides major opportunities to increase the supply and use of sound health statistics. First, the emphasis on monitoring and evaluation is leading to proliferation of indicators and excessive reporting requirements, and needs to be refocused on systematic investments in data generation and analysis. Second, the risk of inadequate or poorly targeted investments can be kept to a minimum by understanding the causes of poor availability of health statistics, including lack of accurate measurement instruments, application of suboptimum methods of data collection, and inadequate use of methods and analyses to produce comparable estimates. Third, the preoccupation with MDGs does not take into account the rapid health transition, which implies that health statistics should systematically include a much wider array of health issues from acute infectious diseases to chronic non-communicable diseases and injuries, disaggregated by socioeconomic position. Fourth, the growing number of national household surveys, which are the main source of most population health statistics, need to be streamlined into cohesive and comprehensive country health survey programmes. Now is the time to accelerate the production and use of accurate, complete, and timely health statistics for decision-making by investing in country health information systems that should be based on an efficient and effective mix of standardised methods of data collection and analysis that meet country and international needs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prognostic studies of breast cancer survivability have been aided by machine learning algorithms, which can predict the survival of a particular patient based on historical patient data. However, it is not easy to collect labeled patient records. It takes at least 5 years to label a patient record as 'survived' or 'not survived'. Unguided trials of numerous types of oncology therapies are also very expensive. Confidentiality agreements with doctors and patients are also required to obtain labeled patient records.$\backslash$nPROPOSED METHOD: These difficulties in the collection of labeled patient data have led researchers to consider semi-supervised learning (SSL), a recent machine learning algorithm, because it is also capable of utilizing unlabeled patient data, which is relatively easier to collect. Therefore, it is regarded as an algorithm that could circumvent the known difficulties. However, the fact is yet valid even on SSL that more labeled data lead to better prediction. To compensate for the lack of labeled patient data, we may consider the concept of tagging virtual labels to unlabeled patient data, that is, 'pseudo-labels,' and treating them as if they were labeled.$\backslash$nRESULTS: Our proposed algorithm, 'SSL Co-training', implements this concept based on SSL. SSL Co-training was tested using the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database for breast cancer and it delivered a mean accuracy of 76{\%} and a mean area under the curve of 0.81.},

It began with the enunciation of a framework that specified a parsimonious set of key goals to which health systems contribute, and the first set of figures on goal attainment and health system efficiency in countries that were Members of the Organization was published in The World Health Report 2000. This book provides a uniquely comprehensive exploration of many different facets of health systems performance assessment. It will be relevant for researchers, students and decision-makers seeking a more detailed understanding of concepts, methods and the latest empirical findings. While most authors in this volume take a global perspective, the findings have important implications for the development of national performance frameworks and the creation of a culture of accountability.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Plasmodium vivax malaria is an important public health issue in the Amazon region, and it accounts for approximately 84{\%} of cases of the disease. Migration across the border between Brazil and French Guiana contributes to the maintenance of the disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic and parasitological responses of patients with P. vivax malaria treated with chloroquine and primaquine in the socio-environmental context of cross-border interactions between Brazil and French Guiana. The factors controlled were diagnostic agreement, adherence, adjustment of primaquine doses for patient weight, and quality of the drugs used.   METHODS:A prospective study was conducted in 2011 with 103 individuals aged 10-60years with a positive diagnosis of P. vivax treated with chloroquine (10mg base/kg on the first day, followed by 7.5mg/kg on the second and third days) and primaquine for 7days, who were followed for 28days. The primaquine doses were adjusted for the patients' weight. A number of factors were determined: epidemiological characteristics, origin of patients, signs and symptoms, initial parasitaemia and parasitaemia clearance time, blood concentrations of chloroquine and primaquine, quality of anti-malarial drugs and diagnostic agreement.RESULTS:Ninety-five patients were followed for 28days. There was a 100{\%} agreement in microscopic diagnosis between field laboratory and reference centre. The adhesion to the treatment was 100{\%}. Of these patients, 32.6{\%} received a weight-adjusted dose of primaquine. The chloroquine and primaquine tablets were consistent with the optimal quality limits for human consumption. The investigated patients achieved optimal blood exposure to anti-malarial drugs. The parasitological and therapeutic response was adequate in 99.0{\%} of cases.CONCLUSIONS:In the municipality of Oiapoque, the therapeutic regime used for the treatment of P. vivax malaria using chloroquine combined with primaquine remains effective, when external factors are controlled, such as the quality of anti-malarial drugs, the adhesion to the treatment prescribed, the correct diagnostic and the adjustment of primaquine dose for patient body weight.},

abstract = {Malaria has steadily increased in the Peruvian Amazon over the last five years. This study aimed to determine the parasite prevalence and micro-geographical heterogeneity of Plasmodium vivax parasitaemia in communities of the Peruvian Amazon. Four cross-sectional active case detection surveys were conducted between May and July 2015 in four riverine communities in Mazan district. Analysis of 2785 samples of 820 individuals nested within 154 households for Plasmodium parasitaemia was carried out using light microscopy and qPCR. The spatio-temporal distribution of Plasmodium parasitaemia, dominated by P. vivax, was shown to cluster at both household and community levels. Of enrolled individuals, 47{\%} had at least one P. vivax parasitaemia and 10{\%} P. falciparum, by qPCR, both of which were predominantly sub-microscopic and asymptomatic. Spatial analysis detected significant clustering in three communities. Our findings showed that communities at small-to-moderate spatial scales differed in P. vivax parasite prevalence, and multilevel Poisson regression models showed that such differences were influenced by factors such as age, education, and location of households within high-risk clusters, as well as factors linked to a local micro-geographic context, such as travel and occupation. Complex transmission patterns were found to be related to human mobility among communities in the same micro-basin. Progress in reducing the malaria burden in the last decade has been substantial worldwide, yet key challenges remain, particularly with a global emphasis on malaria elimination 1, 2 . According to data after World War II, malaria transmission in Peru has been dominated by Plasmodium vivax.

However, owing to the inherent complexity of machine learning methods, they are prone to misuse. Because of the flexibility in specifying machine learning models, the results are often insufficiently reported in research articles, hindering reliable assessment of model validity and consistent interpretation of model outputs. Objective: To attain a set of guidelines on the use of machine learning predictive models within clinical settings to make sure the models are correctly applied and sufficiently reported so that true discoveries can be distinguished from random coincidence. Methods: A multidisciplinary panel of machine learning experts, clinicians, and traditional statisticians were interviewed, using an iterative process in accordance with the Delphi method. Results: The process produced a set of guidelines that consists of (1) a list of reporting items to be included in a research article and (2) a set of practical sequential steps for developing predictive models. Conclusions: A set of guidelines was generated to enable correct application of machine learning models and consistent reporting of model specifications and results in biomedical research. We believe that such guidelines will accelerate the adoption of big data analysis, particularly with machine learning methods, in the biomedical research community.},

In order to capitalize on these benefits, there are significant challenges to overcome in data analytics. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases held a symposium entitled ‘‘Data Science: Unlocking the Power of Big Data'' to create a forum for big data experts to present and share some of the creative and innovative methods to gleaning valuable knowledge from an overwhelming flood of biological data. A significant investment in infrastructure and tool development, along with more and better-trained data scientists, may facilitate methods for assimilation of data and machine learning, to overcome obstacles such as data security, data cleaning, and data integration.},

abstract = {This paper attempts to explain the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) or inverted U-shaped relationship between income and environmental degradation in the framework of endogenous growth model. Considering a closed economy, one part of capital is used for commodity production, which generates pollution that degrades existing environment, and the remaining part is used for abating pollution (i.e., upgrading environment). Sufficient abatement activity improves/restores environmental quality. A sufficient abatement activity (associated with commodity production) could only lead optimally towards steady state. The ratio of allocation of capital between two sectors (production and abatement) is fixed along the optimal path, but it varies along the non-optimal path that exists in the off-steady state. In the economy, allocation of capital for abatement activity varies over time. Thus, a change from insufficient to sufficient allocation of capital (i.e., investment) for abatement activity is the basis for an inverted U-shaped relationship between environmental quality and economic growth.},

abstract = {Patients with early stage breast cancer can opt for either mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery (BCS), but BCS requires daily radiotherapy for some weeks. The hypothesis that ease of access to radiotherapy might affect choice of surgery was investigated using records of 6014 breast cancer patients in Northern England. Adjusting for the effects of age, deprivation and hospital type, the choice of BCS was not associated with the estimated car journey time to radiotherapy for most women but there was an association for patients living in places without a regular bus service, so transport problems might influence surgery choice for a minority of women. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A critical question is, how will humans interact with and steer these complex models? Initially, users applied direct manipulation to such models the same way they applied it to simpler visualizations in the premodel era--using control panels to directly manipulate model parameters. However, opportunities are arising for direct manipulation of the model outputs, where the users' thought processes take place, rather than the inputs. This article presents this new agenda for direct manipulation for visual analytics.},

abstract = {Background: Electronic health record (EHR) databases contain vast amounts of information about patients. Machine learning techniques such as Boosting and support vector machine (SVM) can potentially identify patients at high risk for serious conditions, such as heart disease, from EHR data. However, these techniques have not yet been widely tested. Objective: To model detection of heart failure more than 6 months before the actual date of clinical diagnosis using machine learning techniques applied to EHR data. To compare the performance of logistic regression, SVM, and Boosting, along with various variable selection methods in heart failure prediction. Research Design: Geisinger Clinic primary care patients with data in the EHR data from 2001 to 2006 diagnosed with heart failure between 2003 and 2006 were identified. Controls were randomly selected matched on sex, age, and clinic for this nested case-control study. Measures: Area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operator char- acteristic curve was computed for each method using 10-fold cross- validation. The number of variables selected by each method was compared. Results: Logistic regression with model selection based on Bayes- ian information criterion provided the most parsimonious model, with about 10 variables selected on average, while maintaining a high AUC (0.77 in 10-fold cross-validation). Boosting with strict variable importance threshold provided similar performance. Conclusions: Heart failure was predicted more than 6 months before clinical diagnosis, with AUC of about 0.76, using logistic regression and Boosting. These results were achieved even with strict model selection criteria. SVM had the poorest performance, possibly because of imbalanced data.},

abstract = {It is common to think of statistical graphics and data visualization as relatively modern developments in statistics. In fact, the graphic representation of quantitative information has deep roots. These roots reach into the histories of the earliest map-making and visual depiction, and later into thematic cartography, statistics and statistical graphics, medicine, and other fields. Along the way, developments in technologies (printing, reproduction) mathematical theory and practice, and empirical observation and recording, enabled the wider use of graphics and new advances in form and content. This chapter provides an overview of the intellectual history of data visualization from medieval to modern times, describing and illustrating some significant advances along the way. It is based on a project, called theMilestones Project, to collect, catalog and document in one place the important developments in a wide range of areas and fields that led tomod- ern data visualization. This effort has suggested some questions of the use of present-day methods to analyze and understand this history, that I discuss under the rubric of “statistical historiography.”},

The authors performed a historical survey of environmental and public health issues related to the sector, an analysis of the conceptual frameworks involving public health and sanitation systems, and a systematization of the various effects that water supply and sanitation have on public health and the environment. Evaluation of these effects should guarantee the correct analysis of possible alternatives, deal with environmental and public health objectives (the main purpose of sanitation infrastructure), and provide the most reasonable indication of actions. The suggested systematization of the sanitation systems effects in each step of their implementation is an advance considering the association between the fundamental elements for formulating a planning model for sanitation infrastructure.},

We describe the different levels of estimates used to quantify disease burden and its correlates; understanding how closely linked a type of statistic is to disease and death rates is crucial in designing health policies and programmes. We also suggest questions that people using such statistics should ask and offer tips to help separate advocacy from evidence-based positions. Global health agencies have a key role in communicating robust estimates of disease, as do policymakers at national and subnational levels where key public-health decisions are made. A common framework and standardised methods, building on the work of Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group (CHERG) and others, are urgently needed. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@book{Rosenberg1992,
abstract = {This collection of essays addresses various aspects of 19th Century medicine. The overarching theme is the "therapeutic revolution." In the early 19th C. medicine was holistic and interactive. All parts of the body were involved in disease; all disease was to some degree "psychosomatic." Disease resulted from a disruption of the normal equilibrium; therapeutics sought to restore this equilibrium and help the body along its normal course of recovery. In the essay on body and mind, Rosenberg argues that the same doctors therefore treated diseases of both body and mind and had to distinguish between diseases the patient brought on himself (indulgent) vs. true "somatic" diseases. Only late in the century, with Freud, did mental diseases come to be seen as separate and be treated by specialists. Florence Nightingale was a part of the 19th C. holism. She rejected both contagionism and later the germ theory not because she couldn't understand them but because they were at best irrelevant and at worst destructive to her holistic, social style of treating disease. To her, thereapeutics didn't cure people; people cured themselves. The nurse was among the most important health practitioners because it was she who provided the appropriate (i.e., clean and healthful) environment for the patient to cure himself. In the essay on cholera, Rosenberg aruges that epidemics and responses to them act as barometers for general changes in Western thinking. John Snow's "ruthless" reductionism in applying epidemiology to cholera epidemics seems quite modern. Chemical, the telegraph, social organization workers were all characteristic strategies being developed in the 19th C. and are clearly seen among public health workers. In the section on institutions Rosenberg looks at medicine in New York City in 1965, showing how it was characterized by an interdependence of ideas and institutional context and of social status and learning. The dispensary was a major feature of 19th C. medicine, but had died out by the early 1920s. Its demise was due not so much to changing policy or conspiracy among physicians or politicians, but to changing values and priorities among physicians. It ceased to fill a useful role to physicians. Phildelphia General Hospital serves as another case study. It began in the 18th C. as an almshouse, a healthcare facility for the poor with strong moral component. By the 20th C. it had become increasingly medicalized, with a reputation for teaching and sophisticated instrumentation, but it could not shake its almshouse roots. A chapter on John S. Billings, son of the famous John Shaw Billings, and his efforts to make it into the medical elite of late 19th C. NYC offers a different strategy and underlines the value of biography in history. A final section of modern medical problems and philosophical issues probes the nature of epidemics and explores AIDS as a "postmodern" epidemic, though one with considerable social parallels to cholera in the 19th C. AIDS is postmodern because it does not fit within either the social constructivist or reductionist models of disease--it needs to be treated as both. In the title essay, Rosenberg offers terminology to explain the two sides of the therapeutic revolution. The holistic, interactive early 19th C. style he calls "configurationist." This was replaced by a "contaminationist" model of disease by the late 19th C. The germ theory, new technological advances, and increasing specialization among physicians shaped a new view, in which diseases were external and specific to their agents. Disease became local, affecting tissues and organs, not the whole individual. Though the contaminationist model persists in medicine, many social reformers maintain a more configurationist model and use it to critique the medical establishment. The two models thus both mirror and imply social policy.},

abstract = {Sound statistics are a key component of evidence. However, many institutional, political, and practical barriers impede effective use of data to inform policy. In the fourth paper in this Series on health statistics, we look at the relation between health statistics and policymaking at country and global levels. We propose a fourfold framework to help the transition from data to policy. Good practices include: (1) reconciling statistics from different sources; (2) fostering communication and transparency, including reaching out to the media for dissemination; (3) promoting country ownership of data and statistical analyses; and (4) addressing conflicts of interest, including those arising when workers responsible for attainment of health goals are also charged with measurement and monitoring of progress. Further investments are needed not only in primary data collection across a full range of sources but also in building capacity in countries to analyse, interpret, and present statistics effectively in ways that are meaningful and useful for policymaking. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The paper provides a review of some of the thoughts, ideas, and opinions that pervade the public health literature concerning how to classify or conceptualise violence. It is argued that violence transcends classic distinctions between communicable and non-communicable diseases, distinguishes itself from the discipline of injury control, and is influenced by wider, social determinants. Through a discussion of these varied perspectives it is concluded that a fourth revolution in public health is needed - a 'change in scope' revolution - that recognizes the influence of social justice, economics, and globalization in the aetiology of premature death and ill health, into which violence fits. However, rather than be shackled by debates of definition or classification, it is important that public health acknowledges the role it can play in preventing violence through policy and practice, and takes unified action.},

abstract = {Health statistics are at the centre of an increasing number of worldwide health controversies. Several factors are sharpening the tension between the supply and demand for high quality health information, and the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) provide a high-profile example. With thousands of indicators recommended but few measured well, the worldwide health community needs to focus its efforts on improving measurement of a small set of priority areas. Priority indicators should be selected on the basis of public-health significance and several dimensions of measurability. Health statistics can be divided into three types: crude, corrected, and predicted. Health statistics are necessary inputs to planning and strategic decision making, programme implementation, monitoring progress towards targets, and assessment of what works and what does not. Crude statistics that are biased have no role in any of these steps; corrected statistics are preferred. For strategic decision making, when corrected statistics are unavailable, predicted statistics can play an important part. For monitoring progress towards agreed targets and assessment of what works and what does not, however, predicted statistics should not be used. Perhaps the most effective method to decrease controversy over health statistics and to encourage better primary data collection and the development of better analytical methods is a strong commitment to provision of an explicit data audit trail. This initiative would make available the primary data, all post-data collection adjustments, models including covariates used for farcasting and forecasting, and necessary documentation to the public.},

abstract = {Governments and health agencies worldwide are planning for a potential influenza pandemic. Their plans acknowledge the importance of public communication during an outbreak and include related guidelines and strategies. Emerging infectious disease (EID) communication is a new addition to the literature, drawing on health promotion communication, crisis communication and environmental/technological risk communication. This paper adds to the literature, exploring the notion of ‘effective communication during health crises' by reporting on interviews with 22 public health officials, scientists and communications professionals responsible for communicating with the public. When analyzed in the context of the risk communication literature, the interviews reveal several considerations for health risk communicators. First, given the important role that mass media will play in an EID outbreak, there is an urgent need for public health to build partnerships with journalists based on an understanding of the two parties' unique societal roles. Second, seemingly practical communications considerations—such as how certain to be about information before sharing it and whether to engage in two-way communication with the public—have ethical dimensions that deserve attention. Third, there are unique challenges associated with communicating uncertainty, which would benefit from an exploration of the role of trust in health crisis communication.

A total of 884 HIV-1 B subtype pol gene sequences from 306 drug-na??ve (40 recently and 266 chronically infected) and 578 drug-treated HIV-1 infected patients were collected through routine drug-resistance testing between 2000 and 2008 in a single center (Division of Infectious Disease, Bergamo, Northern Italy). Bayesian phylogenetic tree was reconstructed and transmission clusters were recognized using a posterior probability as statistical support of each cluster. Differences among clustered and non-clustered drug-resistance mutations were assessed by Fisher's exact test.In our cohort we identified five clusters including ???6 sequences with the root posterior probability of 100{\%}. Dated phylogenies reconstructed through Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo model was possible for only two main clade (???10 sequences) originated between 1990 and 2002.Among the 306 drug-na??ve individuals, 12{\%} carried a viral strain with at least 1 major mutation associated with transmitted drug resistance and 36{\%} of these strains were involved in significant clusters.We report for the first time that many (34{\%}) of HIV-1 subtype B transmission clusters indentified in Italy were only composed by drug-na??ve individuals and that the 14{\%} of transmitted drug resistance was linked to transmission clusters composed only of newly diagnosed individuals. The phylogenetic analysis was performed on a large cohort of drug-na??ve recently/chronically infected individuals where drug-experienced patients represent almost all infected individuals in a restricted geographical area.Our findings highlight the role of newly diagnosed individuals, not yet exposed to antiretroviral drugs, in the transmission of drug-resistant HIV-1 strains, providing new insights for the planning and management of treatment programs in developing countries. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Parameter estimation for mechanistic models of infectious disease can be computationally intensive. Nsoesie et al. (2011) introduced an approach for inference on infectious disease data based on the idea of supervised learning. Their method involves simulating epidemics from various infectious disease models, and using classifiers built from the epidemic curve data to predict which model were most likely to have generated observed epidemic curves. They showed that the classification approach could fairly identify underlying characteristics of the disease system, without fitting various transmission models via, say, Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo. We extend this work to the case where the underlying infectious disease model is inherently spatial. Our goal is to compare the use of global epidemic curves for building the classifier, with the use of spatially stratified epidemic curves. We demonstrate these methods on simulated data and apply the method to analyze a tomato spotted wilt virus epidemic dataset.},

@article{Murray2000,
abstract = {Health systems vary widely in performance, and countries with similar levels of income, education and health expenditure differ in their ability to attain key health goals. This paper proposes a framework to advance the understanding of health system performance. A first step is to define the boundaries of the health system, based on the concept of health action. Health action is defined as any set of activities whose primary intent is to improve or maintain health. Within these boundaries, the concept of performance is centred around three fundamental goals: improving health, enhancing responsiveness to the expectations of the population, and assuring fairness of financial contribution. Improving health means both increasing the average health status and reducing health inequalities. Responsiveness includes two major components: (a) respect for persons (including dignity, confidentiality and autonomy of individuals and families to decide about their own health); and (b) client orientation (including prompt attention, access to social support networks during care, quality of basic amenities and choice of provider). Fairness of financial contribution means that every household pays a fair share of the total health bill for a country (which may mean that very poor households pay nothing at all). This implies that everyone is protected from financial risks due to health care. The measurement of performance relates goal attainment to the resources available. Variation in performance is a function of the way in which the health system organizes four key functions: stewardship (a broader concept than regulation); financing (including revenue collection, fund pooling and purchasing); service provision (for personal and non-personal health services); and resource generation (including personnel, facilities and knowledge). By investigating these four functions and how they combine, it is possible not only to understand the proximate determinants of health system performance, but also to contemplate major policy challenges.},

We examined 98 oncology drugs from the top 50 pharmaceutical companies (2006 sales) that first entered clinical development from 1999 to 2007, had been taken to at least phase II development, and had a known final outcome (research abandonment or regulatory marketing approval). Data on safety, efficacy, operational, market, and company characteristics were obtained from public sources. Logistic regression and machine-learning methods were used to provide an unbiased approach to assess overall predictability and to identify the most important individual predictors. We found that a simple four-factor model (activity, number of patients in the pivotal phase II trial, phase II duration, and a prevalence-related measure) had high sensitivity and specificity for predicting regulatory marketing approval.},

The goal is to maximize the system-wide probability of detecting an "event of interest" against a noisy background, subject to a constraint on the expected number of false signals. We use nonlinear programming to appropriately set detection thresholds taking into account the probability of an event of interest occurring somewhere in the coverage area. Using this approach, public health officials can "tune" their biosurveillance systems to optimally detect various threats, thereby allowing practitioners to focus their public health surveillance activities. Given some distributional assumptions, we derive a one-dimensional optimization methodology that allows for the efficient optimization of very large systems. We demonstrate that optimizing a syndromic surveillance system can improve its performance by 20-40{\%}. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Spatial epidemiology is increasingly being used to assess health risks associated with environmental hazards. Risk patterns tend to have both a temporal and a spatial component; thus, spatial epidemiology must combine methods from epidemiology, statistics, and geographic information science. Recent statistical advances in spatial epidemiology include the use of smoothing in risk maps to create an interpretable risk surface, the extension of spatial models to incorporate the time dimension, and the combination of individual- and area-level information. Advances in geographic information systems and the growing availability of modeling packages have led to an improvement in exposure assessment. Techniques drawn from geographic information science are being developed to enable the visualization of uncertainty and ensure more meaningful inferences are made from data. When public health concerns related to the environment arise, it is essential to address such anxieties appropriately and in a timely manner. Tools designed to facilitate the investigation process are being developed, although the availability of complete and clean health data, and appropriate exposure data often remain limiting factors.},

Ultrasonography performed at 29 weeks of gestation revealed microcephaly with calcifications in the fetal brain and placenta. After the mother requested termination of the pregnancy, a fetal autopsy was performed. Micrencephaly (an abnormally small brain) was observed, with almost complete agyria, hydrocephalus, and multifocal dystrophic calcifications in the cortex and subcortical white matter, with associated cortical displacement and mild focal inflammation. ZIKV was found in the fetal brain tissue on reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay, with consistent findings on electron microscopy. The complete genome of ZIKV was recovered from the fetal brain.},

abstract = {For years, we have relied on population surveys to keep track of regional public health statistics, including the prevalence of non-communicable diseases. Because of the cost and limitations of such surveys, we often do not have the up-to-date data on health outcomes of a region. In this paper, we examined the feasibility of inferring regional health outcomes from socio-demographic data that are widely available and timely updated through national censuses and community surveys. Using data for 50 American states (excluding Washington DC) from 2007 to 2012, we constructed a machine-learning model to predict the prevalence of six non-communicable disease (NCD) outcomes (four NCDs and two major clinical risk factors), based on population socio-demographic characteristics from the American Community Survey. We found that regional prevalence estimates for non-communicable diseases can be reasonably predicted. The predictions were highly correlated with the observed data, in both the states included in the derivation model (median correlation 0.88) and those excluded from the development for use as a completely separated validation sample (median correlation 0.85), demonstrating that the model had sufficient external validity to make good predictions, based on demographics alone, for areas not included in the model development. This highlights both the utility of this sophisticated approach to model development, and the vital importance of simple socio-demographic characteristics as both indicators and determinants of chronic disease.},

abstract = {Data preprocessing is a crucial step for mining and learning from data, and one of its primary activities is the transformation of data. This activity is very important in the context of time series prediction since most time series models assume the property of stationarity, i.e., statistical properties do not change over time, which in practice is the exception and not the rule in most real datasets. There are several transformation methods designed to treat nonstationarity in time series. However, the choice of a transformation that is appropriate to the adopted data model and to the problem at hand is not a simple task. This paper provides a review and experimental analysis of methods for transformation of nonstationary time series. The focus of this work is to provide a background on the subject and a discussion on their advantages and limitations to the problem of time series prediction. A subset of the reviewed transformation methods is compared through an experimental evaluation using benchmark datasets from time series prediction competitions and other real macroeconomic datasets. Suitable nonstationary time series transformation methods provided improvements of more than 30{\%} in prediction accuracy for half of the evaluated time series and improved the prediction in more than 95{\%} for 10{\%} of the time series. Furthermore, the adoption of a validation phase during model training enables the selection of suitable transformation methods.},

abstract = {This paper aims at understanding social causality of Tuberculosis in Rio de Janeiro. This is one of the Brazilian states with the highest incidence of this disease. We follow the story of Paulo, a patient who received care at the outpatient clinic for multi-drug resistant Tuberculosis, in Rio de Janeiro. To make sense of his story, we will look at it through the concept of vulnerability in life conditions. Along with Sabroza (2006), we argue that this vulnerability is a collective expression of the economic insertion of a growing segment of Rios population in the current technical-scientific-informational capitalism (Santos, 2002 [1979]). Limitations in the health services add directly to vulnerability in life conditions of patients making treatment a hard endeavour. We propose to think and act on Tuberculosis at the collective level of reality, through intersectoral actions. We aim at contributing to the current debates on the social determination of Tuberculosis, to inform actions that can significantly reduce the suffering associated to this and other similarly caused diseases...(AU)},

SUMMARY: Malaria is still nowadays a major public health problem in Brazil. It is estimated that in the early 40s, approximately 20{\%} of the natio-nal population were infected each year. As a result of the fight against the disease, the number of malaria cases decreased over the years and the smallest number to-date was recorded in the 60s. From the mid-60s onwards, Brazil underwent a rapid and disorganized settlement process in the Amazon and this migratory movement led to a progressive increase in the number of reported cases. Although the main mosquito vector (Anophe-Les darlingi) is present in about 80{\%} of the country's total area, currently the incidence of malaria in Brazil is almost exclusively (more than 99{\%} of the cases) restricted to the region of the Amazon Basin, where a number of combined factors favour disease transmission and impair the use of stan-dard control procedures. Plasmodium vivax accounts for more than 75{\%} and P. falciparum for around 23{\%} of the cases. P. malariae is seldom ob-served and there are no records of autochthonous cases of P. ovale. The present difficulty in reducing economic and social risk factors that deter-mine the incidence of malaria in the Amazona Region render impracticable its eradication in the Region. As a result, and following recommendations of the Malaria Ministerial Conference held in 1992in Amsterdam, a malaria integrated control effort (as ajoint action on the part of the government and the population) directed towards the elimination or reduction of the risks of death or illness, is the new direction adopted by the Brazilian government in the fight against the disease.

abstract = {This paper describes an assessment of the validity of using health state indexes as a means of describing the consequences of traffic injury for public health. Three issues are discussed: (1) Can questionnaire data be used as input for estimating health state values by means of health state indexes? (2) Can the validity of describing the consequences of traffic injury by means of different health state indexes (QALY-indexes) be assessed? (3) Can estimated health state values be used directly as a basis for decision making? It is concluded that questionnaire data can be used as input for health state value estimation. Four health state indexes are compared: The Quality of Well Being Scale, The McMaster Health Classification System, The Rosser and Kind Index and The EuroQol Instrument (transformed version). It is concluded that an assessment of the validity of these indexes is possible, and that the EuroQol Instrument appears to be the most valid of the four indexes that are compared. None of the four indexes give values that are consistent with public policy objectives, but objectives were not set with the benefit of knowing the relative utility loss associated with injuries at different levels of severity.},

abstract = {Aim: This review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of evidence for the use of clinical and quality dashboards in health care environments. Methods: A literature search was performed for the dates 1996-2012 on CINAHL, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsychInfo, Science Direct and ACM Digital Library. A citation search and a hand search of relevant papers were also conducted. Results: One hundred and twenty two full text papers were retrieved of which 11 were included in the review. There was considerable heterogeneity in implementation setting, dashboard users and indicators used. There was evidence that in contexts where dashboards were easily accessible to clinicians (such as in the form of a screen saver) their use was associated with improved care processes and patient outcomes. Conclusion: There is some evidence that implementing clinical and/or quality dashboards that provide immediate access to information for clinicians can improve adherence to quality guidelines and may help improve patient outcomes. However, further high quality detailed research studies need to be conducted to obtain evidence of their efficacy and establish guidelines for their design.},

abstract = {The hypertriglyceridemic waist (HW) phenotype is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes; however, to date, no study has assessed the predictive power of phenotypes based on individual anthropometric measurements and triglyceride (TG) levels. The aims of the present study were to assess the association between the HW phenotype and type 2 diabetes in Korean adults and to evaluate the predictive power of various phenotypes consisting of combinations of individual anthropometric measurements and TG levels. Between November 2006 and August 2013, 11937 subjects participated in this retrospective cross-sectional study. We measured fasting plasma glucose and TG levels and performed anthropometric measurements. We employed binary logistic regression to examine statistically significant differences between normal subjects and those with type 2 diabetes using HW and individual anthropometric measurements. For more reliable prediction results, two machine learning algorithms, naive Bayes (NB) and logistic regression (LR), were used to evaluate the predictive power of various phenotypes. All prediction experiments were performed using a 10-fold cross validation method. Among all of the variables, the presence of HW was most strongly associated with type 2 diabetes (p {\textless}0.001, adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.07 [95{\%} CI, 1.72-2.49] in men; p {\textless} 0.001, adjusted OR = 2.09 [1.79-2.45] in women). When comparing waist circumference (WC) and TG levels as components of the HW phenotype, the association between WC and type 2 diabetes was greater than the association between TG and type 2 diabetes. The phenotypes tended to have higher predictive power in women than in men. Among the phenotypes, the best predictors of type 2 diabetes were waist-to-hip ratio + TG in men (AUC by NB = 0.653, AUC by LR = 0.661) and rib-to-hip ratio + TG in women (AUC by NB = 0.73, AUC by LR = 0.735). Although the presence of HW demonstrated the strongest association with type 2 diabetes, the predictive power of the combined measurements of the actual WC and TG values may not be the best manner of predicting type 2 diabetes. Our findings may provide clinical information concerning the development of clinical decision support systems for the initial screening of type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Brazil is a country of continental dimensions with widespread regional and social inequalities. In this report, we examine the historical development and components of the Brazilian health system, focusing on the reform process during the past 40 years, including the creation of the Unified Health System. A defining characteristic of the contemporary health sector reform in Brazil is that it was driven by civil society rather than by governments, political parties, or international organisations. The advent of the Unified Health System increased access to health care for a substantial proportion of the Brazilian population, at a time when the system was becoming increasingly privatised. Much is still to be done if universal health care is to be achieved. Over the past 20 years, there have been other advances, including investments in human resources, science and technology, and primary care, and a substantial decentralisation process, widespread social participation, and growing public awareness of a right to health care. If the Brazilian health system is to overcome the challenges with which it is presently faced, strengthened political support is needed so that financing can be restructured and the roles of both the public and private sector can be redefined. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Objectives. We applied social network analyses to determine how hospitals within Orange County, California, are interconnected by patient sharing, a system which may have numerous public health implications. Methods. Our analyses considered 2 general patient-sharing networks: uninterrupted patient sharing (UPS; i.e., direct interhospital transfers) and total patient sharing (TPS; i.e., all interhospital patient sharing, including patients with intervening nonhospital stays). We considered these networks at 3 thresholds of patient sharing: at least 1, at least 10, and at least 100 patients shared. Results. Geographically proximate hospitals were somewhat more likely to share patients, but many hospitals shared patients with distant hospitals. Number of patient admissions and percentage of cancer patients were associated with greater connectivity across the system. The TPS network revealed numerous connections not seen in the UPS network, meaning that direct transfers only accounted for a fraction of total patient sharing. Conclusions. Our analysis demonstrated that Orange County's 32 hospitals were highly and heterogeneously interconnected by patient sharing. Different hospital populations had different levels of influence over the patient-sharing network. (Am J Public Health.

abstract = {Abstract To date, health care industry has not fully grasped the potential benefits to be gained from big data analytics. While the constantly growing body of academic research on big data analytics is mostly technology oriented, a better understanding of the strategic implications of big data is urgently needed. To address this lack, this study examines the historical development, architectural design and component functionalities of big data analytics. From content analysis of 26 big data implementation cases in healthcare, we were able to identify five big data analytics capabilities: analytical capability for patterns of care, unstructured data analytical capability, decision support capability, predictive capability, and traceability. We also mapped the benefits driven by big data analytics in terms of information technology (IT) infrastructure, operational, organizational, managerial and strategic areas. In addition, we recommend five strategies for healthcare organizations that are considering to adopt big data analytics technologies. Our findings will help healthcare organizations understand the big data analytics capabilities and potential benefits and support them seeking to formulate more effective data-driven analytics strategies.},

: Identificar aglomerados espaciais de microrregi{\~{o}}es segundo taxas de {\'{o}}bito por acidentes de tr{\^{a}}nsito, no Estado de S{\~{a}}o Paulo, 1 ano antes e 1 ano ap{\'{o}}s a Lei Seca. 

M{\'{E}}TODOS
: Estudo ecol{\'{o}}gico e explorat{\'{o}}rio, no per{\'{i}}odo de 2007 e 2009, em 63 microrregi{\~{o}}es do Estado de SP, Brasil. Utilizaram-se ferramentas de geoprocessamento com dados do DATASUS; analisando {\'{o}}bitos decorrentes de acidentes de tr{\^{a}}nsito em taxas por 100 mil habitantes, construindo coropletes. Nova estat{\'{i}}stica foi obtida subtraindo-se a taxa de 2009 de 2007, observando regi{\~{o}}es de melhora ou piora. 

RESULTADOS
: Em 2007, ocorreram 5.204 {\'{o}}bitos, com m{\'{e}}dia de 83 {\'{o}}bitos/microrregi{\~{a}}o, variando entre 1 e 1.440. J{\'{a}} 2009 obteve 5.065 {\'{o}}bitos com a m{\'{e}}dia de 80 {\'{o}}bitos/microrregi{\~{a}}o, variando entre 1 e 1.453. O coeficiente de Moran em 2007 foi I=0,09 (p=0,04) com correla{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o espacial positiva e 2009 obteve I=0,04 (p=0,16), sem correla{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o. A diferen{\c{c}}a entre as taxas obteve I=0,23 (p=0, 007), indicando associa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o espacial. Em 2007, Presidente Prudente, Rio Claro, Campinas, Bragan{\c{c}}a Paulista, Osasco e S{\~{a}}o Paulo tiveram altas taxas de {\'{o}}bito. Dessas regi{\~{o}}es citadas, somente Osasco n{\~{a}}o se destacou em 2009. Ribeir{\~{a}}o Preto, Ourinhos e Avar{\'{e}} obtiveram piora em 2009. A diferen{\c{c}}a entre as taxas de 2009 e 2007 mostrou que Amparo, Bragan{\c{c}}a Paulista e Campinas tiveram melhora, e Presidente Prudente e Ourinhos apresentaram piora. 

CONCLUS{\~{A}}O
Foi poss{\'{i}}vel identificar os locais com as maiores taxas de mortalidade, apontando locais onde as a{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es de fiscaliza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o devem ser revisadas. 

OBJECTIVE
To identify special micro-region clusters according to mortality rates resulting from traffic accident in the state of S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Brazil, during the period of one year before and one year after the enactment of the Brazilian Drinking and Driving Law. 

METHODS
Ecological and exploratory study in the period of 2007 and 2009 in 63 micro-regions of the state of S{\~{a}}o Paulo. Geoprocessing tools were used with data from DATASUS (Database of the Brazilian Unified Health System), in order to analyze deaths resulting from traffic accidents at rates per 100,000 inhabitants and to build choropleth maps. New statistics were obtained by subtracting the 2009 rate from the 2007 rate, and regions with improvement or deterioration were observed. 

RESULTS
In 2007, there were 5,204 deaths, averaging 83 deaths/micro-region, and ranging from 1 to 1,440. In 2009, there were 5,065 deaths, averaging 80 deaths/micro-region, and ranging from 1 to 1453. In 2007, the Moran's coefficient was I=0.09 (p=0.04), with positive spatial correlation; in 2009, the coeficient was I=0.04 (p=0.16), with no correlation. The difference between rates was I=0.23 (p=0.007), indicating spatial association. In 2007, Presidente Prudente, Rio Claro, Campinas, Bragan{\c{c}}a Paulista, Osasco, and S{\~{a}}o Paulo presented high mortality rates. Of these regions, only Osasco did not stand out in 2009. Ribeir{\~{a}}o Preto, Ourinhos, and Avar{\'{e}} deteriorated in 2009. The difference between the 2009 and 2007 rates showed that Amparo, Bragan{\c{c}}a Paulista, and Campinas improved, and that Presidente Prudente and Ourinhos deteriorated. 

CONCLUSION
It was possible to identify the places with higher mortality rates, pointing out locations where enforcement actions should be reviewed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Road accidents are the tenth leading cause of premature death worldwide and, based on current trends, are likely to become the third leading cause of disability-adjusted life years lost by 2020. Road mortality varies in time and space both between countries and also between regions within the same country. Identifying and understanding the background of regional differences may lead to better understanding of the sources of road accidents, and enable the application of more effective road safety policies. METHODS: A Bayesian ecological regression model based on a unified generalized linear mixed model framework is introduced. Population density and country (affiliation) were used as covariates and were fitted into the model at the four levels of spatial aggregation known as 'nomenclature of statistical territorial units (NUTS) regional classification'. RESULTS: Population density has a significant influence on road mortality. For all countries together, the elasticity estimate is -0.32, meaning that a 10{\%} increase in population density is linked to a 3.2{\%} decrease in road fatalities. A multi-level model defined at the NUTS-3 level, taking into account the NUTS-2 aggregation, enables infraregional variances in road mortality to be taken into account and produces the most reliable estimates of the model parameters. Variation in the Bayes relative risk (the mortality ratio 'standardized' by population density and country effect) is highest at the NUTS-3 level, but is lower at country level and NUTS-2 level, which suggests that other important underlying factors are responsible for the variations in road mortality between regions. Mapping the Bayes relative risk enables the identification of regions that should be targeted by national and regional policies. Last but not least, a new ranking of European countries according to their road mortality risk, adjusted for population density, is presented.},

A statistical approach to this problem will be outlined and the various steps of a system based on this approach will be described. Steps include the statistical analysis of a collection of documents in a field of interest, the establishment of a set of “notions” and the vocabulary by which they are expressed, the compilation of a thesaurus-type dictionary and index, the automatic encoding of documents by machine with the aid of such a dictionary, the encoding of topological notations (such as branched structures), the recording of the coded information, the establishment of a searching pattern for finding pertinent information, and the programming of appropriate machines to carry out a search.},

@article{Reis2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advanced disease-surveillance systems have been deployed worldwide to provide early detection of infectious disease outbreaks and bioterrorist attacks. New methods that improve the overall detection capabilities of these systems can have a broad practical impact. Furthermore, most current generation surveillance systems are vulnerable to dramatic and unpredictable shifts in the health-care data that they monitor. These shifts can occur during major public events, such as the Olympics, as a result of population surges and public closures. Shifts can also occur during epidemics and pandemics as a result of quarantines, the worried-well flooding emergency departments or, conversely, the public staying away from hospitals for fear of nosocomial infection. Most surveillance systems are not robust to such shifts in health-care utilization, either because they do not adjust baselines and alert-thresholds to new utilization levels, or because the utilization shifts themselves may trigger an alarm. As a result, public-health crises and major public events threaten to undermine health-surveillance systems at the very times they are needed most.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: To address this challenge, we introduce a class of epidemiological network models that monitor the relationships among different health-care data streams instead of monitoring the data streams themselves. By extracting the extra information present in the relationships between the data streams, these models have the potential to improve the detection capabilities of a system. Furthermore, the models' relational nature has the potential to increase a system's robustness to unpredictable baseline shifts. We implemented these models and evaluated their effectiveness using historical emergency department data from five hospitals in a single metropolitan area, recorded over a period of 4.5 y by the Automated Epidemiological Geotemporal Integrated Surveillance real-time public health-surveillance system, developed by the Children's Hospital Informatics Program at the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology on behalf of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. We performed experiments with semi-synthetic outbreaks of different magnitudes and simulated baseline shifts of different types and magnitudes. The results show that the network models provide better detection of localized outbreaks, and greater robustness to unpredictable shifts than a reference time-series modeling approach.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The integrated network models of epidemiological data streams and their interrelationships have the potential to improve current surveillance efforts, providing better localized outbreak detection under normal circumstances, as well as more robust performance in the face of shifts in health-care utilization during epidemics and major public events.},

abstract = {Objectives: Current guidelines support the use of screening for early detection in breast, prostate, colorectal and cervical cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether insurance status predicts for more advanced disease in these four currently screened cancers. Study design: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was queried for breast, prostate, colorectal and cervix in patients aged 18-64 years. The database was queried from 2007 to 2011, with 425,614 patients with known insurance status included. Methods: Multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate insurance status and cancer presentation. Results: Under multivariate analysis for breast cancer, uninsured patients more often had invasive disease (odds ratio [OR]: 1.55), T- (OR: 2.00), N- (OR: 1.59) stage, and metastatic disease (OR: 3.48), and were more often high-grade (OR: 1.21). For prostate cancer, uninsured patients again presented more commonly with higher T-stage (OR: 1.45), nodal (OR: 2.90) and metastatic (OR: 4.98) disease, in addition to higher prostate-specific antigen (OR: 2.85) and Gleason score (OR: 1.65). Colorectal cancer had similar findings with uninsured individuals presenting with more invasive disease (OR: 1.78), higher T (OR: 1.86), N (OR: 1.22), and M (OR: 1.58) stage, in addition to higher carcinoembryonic antigen levels (OR: 1.66). Similar results were seen for cervical cancer with uninsured having higher T (OR: 2.03), N (OR: 1.21), and M (OR: 1.45) stage. Conclusion: In the four cancers detected by screening exams, those without health insurance present with more advanced disease, with higher stage and grade, and more elevated tumour markers.},

abstract = {Abstract. This paper summarizes contributions of GIS in epidemiology, and identifies needs required to support spatial epidemiology as science. The objective of spatial epidemiology is to identify disease causes and correlates by relating spatial disease patterns to geographic variation in health risks. GIS supports disease mapping, location analysis, the characterization of populations, and spatial statistics and modeling. Although laudable, these accomplishments are not sufficient to fully identify disease causes and correlates. One reason is the failure of present-day GIS to provide tools appropriate for epidemiology. Two needs are most pressing. First, we must reject the static view: meaningful inference about the causes of disease is impossible without both spatial and temporal information. Second, we need models that translate space-time data on health outcomes and putative exposures into epidemiologically meaningful measures. The first need will be met by the design and implementation of space-time information systems for epidemiology; the second by process-based disease models.

abstract = {This paper describes the Chilean health system, including its structure, financing, beneficiaries, and its physical, material and human resources. This system has two sectors, public and private. The public sector comprises all the organisms that constitute the National System of Health Services, which covers 70{\%} of the population, including the rural and urban poor, the low middle-class, the retired, and the self-employed professionals and technicians.The private sector covers 17.5{\%} of the population, mostly the upper middle-class and the high-income population. A small proportion of the population uses private health services and pays for them out-of-pocket. Around l0{\%} of the population is covered by other public agencies, basically the Health Services for the Armed Forces. The system was recently reformed with the establishment of a Universal System of Explicit Entitlements, which operates through a Universal Plan of Explicit Entitlements (AUGE), which guarantees timely access to treatment for 56 health problems, including cancer in children, breast cancer, ischaemic heart disease, HIV/AIDS and diabetes.},

Using the result that under the null hypothesis of no misspecification an asymptotically efficient estimator must have zero asymptotic covariance with its difference from a consistent but asymptotically inefficient estimator, specification tests are devised for a number of model specifications in econometrics. Local power is calculated for small departures from the null hypothesis. An instrumental variable test as well as tests for a time series cross section model and the simultaneous equation model are presented. An empirical model provides evidence that unobserved individual factors are present which are not orthogonal to the included right-hand-side variable in a common econometric specification of an individual wage equation.},

abstract = {The amount of data produced within Health Informatics has grown to be quite vast, and analysis of this Big Data grants potentially limitless possibilities for knowledge to be gained. In addition, this information can improve the quality of healthcare offered to patients. However, there are a number of issues that arise when dealing with these vast quantities of data, especially how to analyze this data in a reliable manner. The basic goal of Health Informatics is to take in real world medical data from all levels of human existence to help advance our understanding of medicine and medical practice. This paper will present recent research using Big Data tools and approaches for the analysis of Health Informatics data gathered at multiple levels, including the molecular, tissue, patient, and population levels. In addition to gathering data at multiple levels, multiple levels of questions are addressed: human-scale biology, clinical-scale, and epidemic-scale. We will also analyze and examine possible future work for each of these areas, as well as how combining data from each level may provide the most promising approach to gain the most knowledge in Health Informatics.},

abstract = {Throughout the history of epidemiology, visualizations have been used as the interface between public-health professionals and epidemiological data. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of the level of abstraction when using visualizations on routine infectious disease control. We developed three interactive visualization prototypes at increasing levels of abstraction to communicate subsets of influenza outbreak surveillance information. The visualizations were assessed through workshops in an exploratory evaluation with infectious disease epidemiologists. The results show that despite the potential of processed, abstract, and information-dense representations, increased levels of abstraction decreased epidemiologists' understanding and confidence in visualizations. Highly abstract representations were deemed not applicable in routine practice without training. Infectious disease epidemiologists' work routines and decision-making need to be further studied in order to develop visualizations that meet both the quality requirements imposed by policy-makers and the contextual nature of work practice.},

Based on administrative data made available by the Ministry of Health of Brazil (DATASUS-MS), the system allows the representation of patients' flow from residence to hospital, as well as information on performed medical procedures, diagnoses and other patient and hospital characteristics. Residences are represented in terms of their postal codes and admission diagnosis according to the ICD-10 classification. The system has a flexible and simple geographic coordinates input module, and can be used even when no standard coordinates system (e.g., Mercator) are available. It provides two types of graphical representation: ‘static' (concerning characteristics of a hospital or geographical area) and ‘dynamic' (residence to hospital flow). Its use is exemplified with a geographical representation of access to ultra-sound exams in selected hospitals in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, July 1998. In conclusion, the system seems a powerful instrument for health needs identification and planning, as well as for quality assessment and for the generation of information useful for epidemiological research.},

Methods Stool isolation data of Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter from patients of a large Health Maintenance Organization were analyzed weekly by ArcGIS and SaTScan, and cluster results were sent promptly to local departments of health (LDOHs). Results During eighteen months, we identified 52 Shigella sonnei clusters, two Salmonella clusters, and no Campylobacter clusters. S. sonnei clusters lasted from one to 33 days and included three to 30 individuals. Thirty-one (60{\%}) of the S. sonnei clusters were known to LDOHs prior to cluster analysis. Clusters not previously known by the LDOHs prompted epidemiologic investigations. In 31 of the 37 (84{\%}) confirmed clusters, educational institutes (nursery schools, kindergartens, and a primary school) were involved. Conclusions Cluster analysis demonstrated capability to complement enteric disease surveillance. Scaling up the system can further enhance timely detection and control of outbreaks.},

abstract = {Since its publication in 1958, George Rosen's classic treatise has remained the only comprehensive international account of the history of public health. Long available only through antiquarian bookstores, A History of Public Health now returns to print in a paperback edition that supplements the original text with Elizabeth Fee's new introduction and Edward T. Morman's biographical essay and bibliography. George Rosen discusses the evolution of public health in classical Greece, imperial Rome, England, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, the United States, and other countries. He also presents the lives and history-making contributions of the great figures in public health. Approaching the subject from a broad point of view, Rosen considers community health problems of different periods in terms of their political, social, and economic patterns. Among the topics discussed are the prevalence of disease, the water supply and sewage disposal, epidemiological theory, maternal and child health, nutrition, occupational health, health education, public health administration, communicable disease control, medical care, statistics, public policy, and medical geography. A new introduction by Elizabeth Fee places the work in the context of both the earlier and later historiography of public health. Fee identifies Rosen's agenda in relation to trends in medical history and the politics of public health in the 1950s. She also assesses the impact of Rosen's book and identifies new problems in public health that have arisen since its first publication.},

We also detail the data mining process to apply machine learning-based techniques in death risk classification for maternal, neonatal and infant patients. We present an experiment pipeline to estimate average performance and evaluated machine learning models with different features combinations. Additionally, we show a web service which provides multiple predictive models by information availability. Results show Random Forest obtaining better performance when compared to the other machine learning methods.},

This research examines neighbourhood access to primary health care in the city of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. A modification of the Two Step Floating Catchment Area method is used to measure multiple spatial and aspatial (social) dimensions of potential access to primary health care in natural neighbourhoods of Mississauga. The analysis reveals that neighbourhood-level potential access to primary care is dependant on spatial and aspatial dimensions of access selected for examination. The results also show that potential accessibility is reduced for linguistic minorities as well as for recent immigrant populations who appear, on the surface, to have better access to walk-in clinics than dedicated physicians. The research results reinforce the importance of focusing on intra-urban variations in access to care and demonstrate the utility of a new approach for studying neighbourhood impacts that better represents spatial variations in health care access and demand. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In order to bridge this knowledge gap, this study proposes a big data analytics-enabled business value model in which we use the resource-based theory (RBT) and capability building view to explain how big data analytics capabilities can be developed and what potential benefits can be obtained by these capabilities in the health care industries. Using this model, we investigate 109 case descriptions, covering 63 healthcare organizations to explore the causal relationships between the big data analytics capabilities and business value and the path-to-value chains for big data analytics success. Our findings provide new insights to healthcare practitioners on how to constitute big data analytics capabilities for business transformation and offer an empirical basis that can stimulate a more detailed investigation of big data analytics implementation.},

We aim to discuss how the Brazilian National Health Information Systems can help to assess the impact of the ZIKV epidemic on health outcomes potentially related to ZIKV. Health outcomes potentially related to ZIKV infection were described based on a literature review of published studies on ZIKV infection outcomes and on recent protocols developed and published by the Brazilian Ministry of Health for different stages of the life cycle. These outcomes were correlated with the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) classification system, as this is the diagnostic classification registered in the Health Information System. A suggested list of 50 clinical manifestations, dispersed into 4 ICD chapters, and their information sources was created to help monitor the ZIKV epidemics and trends. Correlation of these selected ICD-10 codes and the HIS, as well as, a review of the potentialities and limitations of health information systems were performed. The potential of the Health Information System and its underutilization by stakeholders and researchers have been a barrier in diagnosing and reporting ZIKV infection and its complications. The ZIKV outbreak is still a challenge for health practice and the Brazilian Health Information System.},

We defined the key concepts of time series analysis (trends, seasonal and cyclical variation, association and random variation), and how they can be applied to epidemiology. Methods to assess trends (annual percent change), based on Prais-Winsten regression models, and to quantify seasonal variation (Serfling model) were presented.

abstract = {In spite of significant progress towards malaria control and elimination achieved in South America in the 2000s, this mosquito-transmitted tropical disease remains an important public health concern in the region. Most malaria cases in South America come from Amazon rain forest areas in northern countries, where more than half of malaria is caused by Plasmodium vivax, while Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence has decreased in recent years. This review discusses current malaria data, policies and challenges in four South American Amazon countries: Brazil, Colombia, Peru and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Challenges to continuing efforts to further decrease malaria incidence in this region include: a significant increase in malaria cases in recent years in Venezuela, evidence of submicroscopic and asymptomatic infections, peri-urban malaria, gold mining-related malaria, malaria in pregnancy, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and primaquine use, and possible under-detection of Plas-modium malariae. Some of these challenges underscore the need to implement appropriate tools and procedures in specific regions, such as a field-compatible molecular malaria test, a P. malariae-specific test, malaria diagnosis and appropriate treatment as part of regular antenatal care visits, G6PD test before primaquine administration for P. vivax cases (with weekly primaquine regimen for G6PD deficient individuals), single low dose of primaquine for P. falcipa-rum malaria in Colombia, and national and regional efforts to contain malaria spread in Venezuela urgently needed especially in mining areas. Joint efforts and commitment towards malaria control and elimination should be strate-gized based on examples of successful regional malaria fighting initiatives, such as PAMAFRO and RAVREDA/AMI.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data on causes of death by age and sex are a critical input into health decision-making. Priority setting in public health should be informed not only by the current magnitude of health problems but by trends in them. However, cause of death data are often not available or are subject to substantial problems of comparability. We propose five general principles for cause of death model development, validation, and reporting.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We detail a specific implementation of these principles that is embodied in an analytical tool - the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) - which explores a large variety of possible models to estimate trends in causes of death. Possible models are identified using a covariate selection algorithm that yields many plausible combinations of covariates, which are then run through four model classes. The model classes include mixed effects linear models and spatial-temporal Gaussian Process Regression models for cause fractions and death rates. All models for each cause of death are then assessed using out-of-sample predictive validity and combined into an ensemble with optimal out-of-sample predictive performance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Ensemble models for cause of death estimation outperform any single component model in tests of root mean square error, frequency of predicting correct temporal trends, and achieving 95{\%} coverage of the prediction interval. We present detailed results for CODEm applied to maternal mortality and summary results for several other causes of death, including cardiovascular disease and several cancers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: CODEm produces better estimates of cause of death trends than previous methods and is less susceptible to bias in model specification. We demonstrate the utility of CODEm for the estimation of several major causes of death.},

In controlled studies, having high levels of perceived social support, larger social network, and being married were associated with decreases in relative risk for mortality of 25{\%}, 20{\%}, and 12{\%}, respectively. Moderator analyses revealed that never married patients had higher mortality rates than widowed and divorced/separated patients. Associations of social network with mortality were stronger in younger patients, and associations of marital status with mortality were stronger in studies with shorter time intervals, and in early-stage cancer. Relationships varied by cancer site, with stronger associations of social support observed in studies of patients with leukemia and lymphomas and stronger associations of network size observed in studies of breast cancer.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To analyse the time evolution of the rates of mortality due to motor vehicle traffic accidents (MVTA) injuries that occurred among the general population of Comunitat Valenciana between 1987 and 2011, as well as to identify trend changes by sex and age group. METHODS An observational study of annual mortality trends between 1987 and 2011. We studied all deaths due to MVTA injuries that occurred during this period of time among the non-institutionalised population residing in Comunitat Valenciana (a Spanish Mediterranean region that had a population of 5,117,190 inhabitants in 2011). The rates of mortality due to MVTA injuries were calculated for each sex and year studied. These rates were standardised by age for the total population and for specific age groups using the direct method (age-standardised rate – ASR). Joinpoint regression models were used in order to detect significant trend changes. Additionally, the annual percentage change (APC) of the ASRs was calculated for each trend segment, which is reflected in statistically significant joinpoints. RESULTS For all ages, ASRs decrease greatly in both men and women (70{\%} decrease between 1990 and 2011). In 1990 and 2011, men have rates of 36.5 and 5.2 per 100,000 men/year, respectively. In the same years, women have rates of 8.0 and 0.9 per 100,000 women/year, respectively. This decrease reaches up to 90{\%} in the age group 15–34 years in both men and women. ASR ratios for men and women increased over time for all ages: this ratio was 3.9 in 1987; 4.6 in 1990; and 5.8 in 2011. For both men and women, there is a first significant segment (p{\textless}0.05) with an increasing trend between 1987 and 1989–1990. After 1990, there are 3 segments with a significant decreasing APC (1990–1993, 1993–2005 and 2005–2011, in the case of men; and 1989–1996, 1999–2007 and 2007–2011, in the case of women). CONCLUSION The risk of death due to motor vehicle traffic accidents injuries has decreased significantly, especially in the case of women, for the last 25 years in Comunitat Valenciana, mainly as of 2006. This may be a consequence of the road-safety measures that have been implemented in Spain and in Comunitat Valenciana since 2004. The economic crisis that this country has undergone since 2008 may have also been a contributing factor to this decrease. Despite the decrease, ASR ratios for men and women increased over time and it is still a high-risk cause of death among young men. It is thus important that the measures that helped decrease the risk of death are maintained and improved over time.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) has a significant public health impact. This study aimed to examine the effect of socio-ecological factors on the transmission of H1N1 in Brisbane, Australia. 

METHODOLOGY
We obtained data from Queensland Health on numbers of laboratory-confirmed daily H1N1 in Brisbane by statistical local areas (SLA) in 2009. Data on weather and socio-economic index were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and the Australian Bureau of Statistics, respectively. A Bayesian spatial conditional autoregressive (CAR) model was used to quantify the relationship between variation of H1N1 and independent factors and to determine its spatiotemporal patterns. 

RESULTS
Our results show that average increase in weekly H1N1 cases were 45.04{\%} (95{\%} credible interval (CrI): 42.63–47.43{\%}) and 23.20{\%} (95{\%} CrI: 16.10–32.67{\%}), for a 1°C decrease in average weekly maximum temperature at a lag of one week and a 10mm decrease in average weekly rainfall at a lag of one week, respectively. An interactive effect between temperature and rainfall on H1N1 incidence was found (changes: 0.71{\%}; 95{\%} CrI: 0.48–0.98{\%}). The auto-regression term was significantly associated with H1N1 transmission (changes: 2.5{\%}; 95{\%} CrI: 1.39–3.72). No significant association between socio-economic indexes for areas (SEIFA) and H1N1 was observed at SLA level. 

CONCLUSIONS
Our results demonstrate that average weekly temperature at lag of one week and rainfall at lag of one week were substantially associated with H1N1 incidence at a SLA level. The ecological factors seemed to have played an important role in H1N1 transmission cycles in Brisbane, Australia.},

abstract = {Spatial epidemiology is the study of spatial variation in disease risk or incidence. Several ecological processes can result in strong spatial patterns of such risk or incidence: for example, pathogen dispersal might be highly localized, vectors or reservoirs for pathogens might be spatially restricted, or susceptible hosts might be clumped. Here, we briefly describe approaches to spatial epidemiology that are spatially implicit, such as metapopulation models of disease transmission, and then focus on research in spatial epidemiology that is spatially explicit, such as the creation of risk maps for particular geographical areas. Although the spatial dynamics of infectious diseases are the subject of intensive study, the impacts of landscape structure on epidemiological processes have so far been neglected. The few studies that demonstrate how landscape composition (types of elements) and configuration (spatial positions of those elements) influence disease risk or incidence suggest that a true integration of landscape ecology with epidemiology will be fruitful. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite his substantial experience of working in senior managerial positions, Arif Nadeem, the department secretary, finds himself somewhat lost in the numerous department related reports and data sheets that keep on coming from various quarters. He feels under-informed and over-informed at the same time. DOH regularly collects data on a range of indicators and there are multiple systems in place to collect the data from various health facilities. The following four systems are important. First, the District Health Information System (DHIS) collects data on around eighty indicators covering treatment and spread of communicable and non-communicable diseases, human resources, facility utilization, etc. Second, the M{\&}E assistants (MEAs) inspect primary health care facilities and report on fourteen indicators covering the number of patients attended, staff presence, medicine availability, public opinion, etc. Third, the DOH field operatives visit health facilities and report on various aspects of functioning in monthly meetings of officials at the district level. Since 2011, they have been using simple smartphone based applications to enter data on site and transmit it to the points of analyses instantaneously. Fourth, progress on development projects is reported every month on prescribed pro forma covering physical progress as well as the amount spent. In addition, tertiary care hospitals report on various aspects of their functioning on need basis and receipt/expense statements are regularly prepared by the budget and accounts section in the department. Often there is too much information to absorb. There is no effective system of filtering and processing information according to the needs of various managerial tiers. Arif realizes that he needs a dashboard that can provide just enough detail to various users. Arif and his team deliberate on the choice of indicators for the dashboard. There is substantial disagreement on what to include and what to leave. The disagreement partly emanates from a lack of clarity on the mandate of the department and its senior management. Farasat, a key team member, proposes eight key areas for the dashboard. He suggests displaying these eight areas on the main screen and creating links to detailed district, tehsil and facility-wise data on selected indicators. {\textcopyright} 2015, Lahore University of Management Sciences.},

abstract = {More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In 'The Future of Data Analysis', he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or 'data analysis'. Ten to twenty years ago, John Chambers, Bill Cleveland and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland even suggested the catchy name "Data Science" for his envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon is the emergence of "Data Science" programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most recently the Univ. of Michigan, which on September 8, 2015 announced a {\$}100M "Data Science Initiative" that will hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; in general, though, the new initiatives steer away from close involvement with academic statistics departments. This paper reviews some ingredients of the current "Data Science moment", including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether Data Science is really different from Statistics. The now-contemplated field of Data Science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning which adds some technology for 'scaling up' to 'big data'. This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next fifty years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in Data Science is not about mere 'scaling up', but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are 'learning from data', and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than today's Data Science Initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals.},

METHODS We assessed the ophthalmological findings of ten mothers and their infants that had been clinically diagnosed with ZIKV-related microcephaly and presented ocular abnormalities, born from May to December 2015. RESULTS Seven mothers (70.0{\%}) referred symptoms during pregnancy (malaise, rash and arthralgia), of which six (85.7{\%}) were in the first trimester. At the time of exam, no ophthalmological abnormalities were identified in the mothers and they did not report ocular symptoms during pregnancy. Serology was negative in all infants for Toxoplasmosis, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, Syphilis and Human Immunodeficiency Viruses. Ocular findings included macular alterations (gross pigment mottling and/or chorioretinal atrophy) in fifteen eyes (75.0{\%}), and optic nerve abnormalities (hypoplasia with double-ring sign, pallor, and/or increased cup-to-disk ratio) in nine eyes (45.0{\%}).

We highlight new methods and future directions for improving the integrity of medical evidence generated from pragmatic trials, observational studies, and predictive modeling. We also discuss needed methods contributions to further ease data sharing across multi-site EHR data networks. Throughout, we identify opportunities for training and for bolstering collaboration between subject matter experts, methodologists, practicing clinicians, health system leaders to help ensure that methods problems are identified and resulting advancements are translated into mainstream research practice more quickly.},

abstract = {Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a neurodevelopmental disorder. It is characterized by two principal features, microcephaly present at birth and nonprogressive mental retardation. The microcephaly is the consequence of a small but architecturally normal brain, and it is the cerebral cortex that shows the greatest size reduction. There are at least seven MCPH loci, and four of the genes have been identified: MCPH1, encoding Microcephalin; MCPH3, encoding CDK5RAP2; MCPH5, encoding ASPM; and MCPH6, encoding CENPJ. These findings are starting to have an impact on the clinical management of families affected with MCPH. Present data suggest that MCPH is the consequence of deficient neurogenesis within the neurogenic epithelium. Evolutionary interest in MCPH has been sparked by the suggestion that changes in the MCPH genes might also be responsible for the increase in brain size during human evolution. Indeed, evolutionary analyses of Microcephalin and ASPM reveal evidence for positive selection during human and great ape evolution. So an understanding of this rare genetic disorder may offer us significant insights into neurogenic mitosis and the evolution of the most striking differences between us and our closest living relatives: brain size and cognitive ability.},

abstract = {Health policy and systems research (HPSR) is a transdisciplinary field of global importance, with its own emerging standards for creating, evaluating, and utilizing knowledge, and distinguished by a particular orientation towards influencing policy and wider action to strengthen health systems. In this commentary, we argue that the ability of the HPSR field to influence real world change hinges on its becoming more people-centred. We see people-centredness as recognizing the field of enquiry as one of social construction, requiring those conducting HPSR to locate their own position in the system, and conduct and publish research in a manner that foregrounds human agency attributes and values, and is acutely attentive to policy context. Change occurs at many layers of a health system, shaped by social, political, and economic forces, and brought about by different groups of people who make up the system, including service users and communities. The seeds of transformative practice in HPSR lie in amplifying the breadth and depth of dialogue across health system actors in the conduct of research – recognizing that these actors are all generators, sources, and users of knowledge about the system. While building such a dialogic practice, those conducting HPSR must strive to protect the autonomy and integrity of their ideas and actions, and also clearly explain their own positions and the value-basis of their work. We conclude with a set of questions that health policy and systems researchers may wish to consider in making their practice more people-centred, and hence more oriented toward real-world change.},

abstract = {The need to align investments in health research and development (R{\&}D) with public health demands is one of the most pressing global public health challenges. We aim to provide a comprehensive description of available data sources, propose a set of indicators for monitoring the global landscape of health R{\&}D, and present a sample of country indicators on research inputs (investments), processes (clinical trials), and outputs (publications), based on data from international databases. Total global investments in health R{\&}D (both public and private sector) in 2009 reached US{\$}240 billion. Of the US{\$}214 billion invested in high-income countries, 60{\%} of health R{\&}D investments came from the business sector, 30{\%} from the public sector, and about 10{\%} from other sources (including private non-profit organisations). Only about 1{\%} of all health R{\&}D investments were allocated to neglected diseases in 2010. Diseases of relevance to high-income countries were investigated in clinical trials seven-to-eight-times more often than were diseases whose burden lies mainly in low-income and middle-income countries. This report confirms that substantial gaps in the global landscape of health R{\&}D remain, especially for and in low-income and middle-income countries. Too few investments are targeted towards the health needs of these countries. Better data are needed to improve priority setting and coordination for health R{\&}D, ultimately to ensure that resources are allocated to diseases and regions where they are needed the most. The establishment of a global observatory on health R{\&}D, which is being discussed at WHO, could address the absence of a comprehensive and sustainable mechanism for regular global monitoring of health R{\&}D.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although access to cancer care is known to influence patient outcomes, to the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding geographic access to cancer care, and how it may vary by population characteristics. This study estimated travel time to specialized cancer care settings for the continental U.S. population and calculated per capita oncologist supply. METHODS: The closest travel times were estimated using a network analysis of the road distance weighted by travel speeds from the population or geographic centroid of every ZIP area in the continental U.S. to that of the nearest cancer care setting under consideration: National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Cancer Centers, academic medical centers, and oncologists. Alaska and Hawaii were excluded because travel in these states is often not road-based. Population and geographic characteristics including race/ethnicity, income, education, and region were derived from U.S. Census 2000 data and from rural-urban commuting area classifications. Oncologist supply per 100,000 residents in Hospital Referral Regions (pHRRs) was estimated by region. RESULTS: Travel times of {\textless}or=1 hour were estimated for 45.2{\%} of the population to the nearest NCI Cancer Center, 69.4{\%} to the nearest academic-based care, and 91.8{\%} to any specialized cancer care. Native Americans, nonurban dwellers, and residents in the South had the longest travel times to the nearest NCI Cancer Center compared with the overall U.S. population (median [interquartile range (IQR)] in minutes: 155 [62-308], 173 [111-257], and 164 [70-272], vs 78 [27-172], respectively). Travel burdens persisted for Native Americans and nonurban populations across all 3 cancer care settings. For all population strata, travel times markedly increased as the degree of cancer care specialization increased. The median oncologist supply for pHRRs was 2.83 per 100,000 individuals. CONCLUSIONS: There are population groups with limited access to the most specialized cancer care settings.},

Building on research showing that ‘hybrid democracies' are more prone to social violence, this article argues that elite competition for power in the context of limited institutional oversight plays an important role in explaining violence. The framework here presents possible mechanisms linking subnational political dynamics and rates of social violence in poorly institutionalised contexts. It highlights how political competition, concentrated political power, and constraints on cooperation can create opportunity structures where violence is incentivised and the rule of law is undermined. This is examined empirically using sub-national homicide data from over 5000 Brazilian municipalities between 1997 and 2010. Findings suggest violence is greater in contexts that are highly competitive – where political actors face credible challenges and have a more tenuous grip on power – and those where power is highly concentrated – where political actors have held power for longer periods or face limited credible challenges. Findings also suggest violence varies depending on whether interactions between state and municipal government are likely to be constrained or cooperative; and are consistent with literatures emphasising the importance of structural explanations of social violence. In light of on-going democratic transitions across the globe, the article highlights the value of understanding links between institutional context, contentious politics and social violence.},

@article{Pfeiffer2015,
abstract = {Concurrent with global economic development in the last 50 years, the opportunities for the spread of existing diseases and emergence of new infectious pathogens, have increased substantially. The activities associated with the enormously intensified global connectivity have resulted in large amounts of data being generated, which in turn provides opportunities for generating knowledge that will allow more effective management of animal and human health risks. This so-called Big Data has, more recently, been accompanied by the Internet of Things which highlights the increasing presence of a wide range of sensors, interconnected via the Internet. Analysis of this data needs to exploit its complexity, accommodate variation in data quality and should take advantage of its spatial and temporal dimensions, where available. Apart from the development of hardware technologies and networking/communication infrastructure, it is necessary to develop appropriate data management tools that make this data accessible for analysis. This includes relational databases, geographical information systems and most recently, cloud-based data storage such as Hadoop distributed file systems. While the development in analytical methodologies has not quite caught up with the data deluge, important advances have been made in a number of areas, including spatial and temporal data analysis where the spectrum of analytical methods ranges from visualisation and exploratory analysis, to modelling. While there used to be a primary focus on statistical science in terms of methodological development for data analysis, the newly emerged discipline of data science is a reflection of the challenges presented by the need to integrate diverse data sources and exploit them using novel data- and knowledge-driven modelling methods while simultaneously recognising the value of quantitative as well as qualitative analytical approaches. Machine learning regression methods, which are more robust and can handle large datasets faster than classical regression approaches, are now also used to analyse spatial and spatio-temporal data. Multi-criteria decision analysis methods have gained greater acceptance, due in part, to the need to increasingly combine data from diverse sources including published scientific information and expert opinion in an attempt to fill important knowledge gaps. The opportunities for more effective prevention, detection and control of animal health threats arising from these developments are immense, but not without risks given the different types, and much higher frequency, of biases associated with these data.},

abstract = {Background: Political, economic, and epidemiological changes in Brazil have affected health and the health system. We used the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (GBD 2016) results to understand changing health patterns and inform policy responses. Methods: We analysed GBD 2016 estimates for life expectancy at birth (LE), healthy life expectancy (HALE), all-cause and cause-specific mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and risk factors for Brazil, its 26 states, and the Federal District from 1990 to 2016, and compared these with national estimates for ten comparator countries. Findings: Nationally, LE increased from 68{\textperiodcentered}4 years (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI] 68{\textperiodcentered}0–68{\textperiodcentered}9) in 1990 to 75{\textperiodcentered}2 years (74{\textperiodcentered}7–75{\textperiodcentered}7) in 2016, and HALE increased from 59{\textperiodcentered}8 years (57{\textperiodcentered}1–62{\textperiodcentered}1) to 65{\textperiodcentered}5 years (62{\textperiodcentered}5–68{\textperiodcentered}0). All-cause age-standardised mortality rates decreased by 34{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (33{\textperiodcentered}4–34{\textperiodcentered}5), while all-cause age-standardised DALY rates decreased by 30{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} (27{\textperiodcentered}7–32{\textperiodcentered}8); the magnitude of declines varied among states. In 2016, ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of age-standardised YLLs, followed by interpersonal violence. Low back and neck pain, sense organ diseases, and skin diseases were the main causes of YLDs in 1990 and 2016. Leading risk factors contributing to DALYs in 2016 were alcohol and drug use, high blood pressure, and high body-mass index. Interpretation: Health improved from 1990 to 2016, but improvements and disease burden varied between states. An epidemiological transition towards non-communicable diseases and related risks occurred nationally, but later in some states, while interpersonal violence grew as a health concern. Policy makers can use these results to address health disparities. Funding: Bill {\&} Melinda Gates Foundation and the Brazilian Ministry of Health.},

abstract = {This paper examines the Kuznets curve relationship for motorcycle deaths. The Kuznets curve describes the inverted U-shape relationship between economic development and, in this case, motorcycle deaths. In early stages of development we expect deaths to increase with increasing motorization. Eventually deaths decrease as technical, policy and political institutions respond to demands for increased safety. We examine this effect as well as some of the factors which might explain the Kuznets relationship: in particular motorcycle helmet laws, medical care and technology improvements, and variables representing the quality of political institutions. We apply a fixed effects negative binomial regression analysis on a panel of 25 countries covering the period 1970-1999. Our results broadly suggest that implementation of road safety regulation, improvement in the quality of political institutions, and medical care and technology developments have contributed to reduced motorcycle deaths.},

abstract = {Zika virus (ZIKV), a previously obscure flavivirus closely related to dengue, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis and yellow fever viruses, has emerged explosively since 2007 to cause a series of epidemics in Micronesia, the South Pacific, and most recently the Americas. After its putative evolution in sub-Saharan Africa, ZIKV spread in the distant past to Asia and has probably emerged on multiple occasions into urban transmission cycles involving Aedes (Stegomyia) spp. mosquitoes and human amplification hosts, accompanied by a relatively mild dengue-like illness. The unprecedented numbers of people infected during recent outbreaks in the South Pacific and the Americas may have resulted in enough ZIKV infections to notice relatively rare congenital microcephaly and Guillain-Barr?? syndromes. Another hypothesis is that phenotypic changes in Asian lineage ZIKV strains led to these disease outcomes. Here, we review potential strategies to control the ongoing outbreak through vector-centric approaches as well as the prospects for the development of vaccines and therapeutics.},

We show how network analysis has its roots in mathematics, statistics, sociology, anthropology, psychology, biology, physics, and computer science. In public health, network analysis has been used to study primarily disease transmission, especially for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases; information transmission, particularly for diffusion of innovations; the role of social support and social capital; the influence of personal and social networks on health behavior; and the interorganizational structure of health systems.

abstract = {Purpose: The emergence and re-emergence of disease outbreaks of international concern in the last several years has raised the importance of health surveillance systems that exploit the open media for their timely and precise detection of events. However, one of the key barriers faced by current event-based health surveillance systems is in identifying fine-grained terms for an outbreak's geographical location. In this article, we present a method to tackle this problem by associating each reported event with the most specific spatial information available in a news report. This would be useful not only for health surveillance systems, but also for other event-centered processing systems. Methods: To develop an automated spatial attribute annotation system, we first created a gold standard corpus for training a machine learning model. Since the qualitative analysis on data suggested that the event class might have an impact on the spatial attribute annotation, we also developed an event classification system to incorporate event class information into the spatial attribute annotation model. To automatically recognize the spatial attribute of events, several approaches, ranging from a simple heuristic technique to a more sophisticated approach based on a state-of-the-art Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) model were explored. Different feature sets were incorporated into the model and compared. Results: The evaluations were conducted on 100 outbreak news articles. Spatial attribute recognition performance was evaluated based on three metrics; precision, recall and the harmonic mean of precision and recall (F-score). Among three strategies proposed in this article, the CRF model appeared to be the most promising for spatial attribute recognition with a best performance of 85.5{\%} F-score (86.3{\%} precision and 84.7{\%} recall). Conclusion: We presented a methodology for associating each event in media outbreak reports with their spatial attribute at the finest level of granularity. Our goal has been to provide a means for enhancing the spatial understanding of outbreak-related events. Evaluation studies showed promising results for automatic spatial attribute annotation. In the future, we plan to explore more features, such as semantic correlation between words, that maybe useful for the spatial attribute annotation task. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {—Performance issues and outages in IT systems have significant impact on business. Traditional methods for identifying these issues based on rules and simple statistics have become ineffective due to the complexity of the underlying systems, the volume and variety of performance metrics collected and the desire to correlate unusual application logging to help diagnosis. This paper examines the problem of providing accurate ranking of disjoint time periods in raw IT system monitoring data by their anomalousness. Given this ranking a decision method can be used to identify certain periods as anomalous with the aim of reducing the various performance metrics and application log messages to a manageable number of timely and actionable reports about unusual system behaviour. In order to be actionable, any such report should aim to provide the minimum context necessary to understand the behaviour it describes. In this paper, we argue that this problem is well suited to analysis with a statistical model of the system state and further that Bayesian methods are particularly well suited to the formulation of this model. To do this we analyse performance data gathered for a real internet banking system. These data highlight some of the challenges for accurately modelling the system state; in brief, very high dimensionality, high overall data rates, seasonality and variability in the data rates, seasonality in the data values, transaction data, mixed data types (continuous data, integer data, lattice data), bounded data, lags between the onset of anomalous behaviour in different performance metrics and non-Gaussian distributions. In order to be successful, subject to the criteria defined above, any approach must be flexible enough to handle all these features of the data. Finally, we present the results of applying robust methods to analyse these data, which were effectively used to pre-empt and diagnose system issues.},

abstract = {With the growing importance of health in the global agenda comes the responsibility to develop a scientific foundation of metrics and evaluation. The scope of this emerging field can be viewed in terms of key topics, including health outcomes, other social outcomes related to health systems, health services, resource inputs, evaluations of programmes and systems, and analyses to support policy choice. It can also be defined in terms of key activities that are needed to strengthen the scientific basis of the field: development of new methods, instruments, software, and hardware; setting global norms and standards for data collection; increasing the availability of high-quality primary data; systematic analysis and synthesis of existing datasets; strengthening national capacity to obtain, analyse, and use data; and reporting and disseminating results. We explore in depth topics with major scientific challenges and institutional and cultural barriers that are slowing the development of the field. Cutting across the various topical areas and disciplinary approaches to these problems are some common scientific issues, including limited comparability of measurement, uncorrected known biases in data, no standard approach to missing data, unrealistic uncertainty estimates, and the use of disease models that have not been properly validated. Only through concerted action will it be possible to assure the production, reproduction, and use of knowledge that is crucial to the advancement of global health. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Objective: To analyze the correlation between breastfeeding in the first hour of life with neonatal mortality rates. Methods: The present study used secondary data from 67 countries, obtained from the Demographic and Health Surveys. Initially, for data analysis, Spearman Correlation (95{\%} CI) and Kernel graphical analysis were employed, followed by a Negative Binomial Poisson regression model, adjusted for potential confounders. Results: Breastfeeding within the first hour of life was negatively correlated with neonatal mortality (Spearman's Rho = -0.245, p = 0.046), and this correlation was stronger among countries with more than 29 neonatal deaths per 1000 newborns (Spearman's Rho = -0.327, p = 0.048). According to the statistical model, countries with the lowest breastfeeding tertiles had 24{\%} higher neonatal mortality rates (Rate ratio = 1.24, 95{\%} CI = 1.07-1.44, p {\textless} 0.05), even when adjusted for potential confounders. Conclusion: The protective effect of breastfeeding during the first hour of life on neonatal mortality in this ecological study is consistent with findings from previous observational studies, indicating the importance of adopting breastfeeding within the first hour as a routine neonatal care practice. {\textcopyright} 2013 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria.

Agglomeration results from a combination of the mean reversion and randomness in the growth of state-industry employment. Although industries' agglomeration levels have declined only slightly over the last quarter century, we find a great deal of movement for many geographically concentrated industries. We decompose aggregate concentration changes into portions attributable to plant births, expansions, contractions, and closures. We find that the location choices of new firms play a deagglomerating role, whereas plant closures have tended to reinforce agglomeration.},

abstract = {Brazil started to experience high traffic accident rates since the 1960s, when road transportation began to be dominant and the number of motorized vehicles increased sharply. The severity of the problem was also related to the fast and uncontrolled urban growth, which allowed for the organization of an inherently dangerous circulation space, characterized by a complex pattern of traffic conflicts. With respect to traffic accidents, the results have been highly negative: national statistics report about 28,000 fatalities a year, with more than 340,000 injured people. The paper analyses current patterns of traffic accidents in urban areas, using the data from two of the three largest cities in the country. Hospital data is analyzed to understand the true social impacts of such accidents. Several causal factors are identified, at the political, cultural and technical sides. Challenges to change current conditions are also identified. Practical measures are suggested, especially the change of the dangerous environment and the need to improve the technical approach to the problem, education programs and enforcement logistics.},

abstract = {Breastfeeding in the first hour after birth is important for the success of breastfeeding and in reducing neonatal mortality. Government policies are being developed in this direction, highlighting the accreditation of hospitals in the Baby-Friendly Hospital (BFH) initiative. The aim of this study was to analyze the association between delivery in a BFH (main exposure), compared to non BFH, and timely initiation of breastfeeding (outcome). Data came from the “Birth in Brazil” survey, a nationwide hospital-based study of postpartum women and their newborns, coordinated by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation. A sample of 22,035 mothers/babies was analyzed through a hierarchical theoretical model on three levels, and all analyzes considered the complex sample design. Odds ratios were obtained by logistic regression, with a 99 {\%} CI. Among all births, 40 {\%} occurred in hospitals accredited or in accreditation process for the BFHI and 52 {\%} of women underwent caesarean section. In the final model, at the distal level, mothers less than 35 years old, and those who lived in the North Region, had a higher chance of timely initiation of breastfeeding. At the intermediate level, prenatal care in the public sector and advice on breastfeeding during pregnancy were directly associated with the outcome. At the proximal level, being born in a Baby-Friendly Hospital and vaginal delivery increased the chance of timely initiation of breastfeeding, while prematurity and low birth weight reduced the chance of the outcome. The chance of being breastfed in the first hour after birth in Baby-Friendly hospitals was twice as high as at non-accredited hospitals, which shows the importance of this initiative for timely initiation of breastfeeding.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Most studies that evaluate the relationship between economic conditions and traffic fatalities focus on the time-series relationship between the two factors. This analysis considers the cross-sectional perspective by estimating the cross-county correlation between per capita income and fatalities per vehicle mile traveled (VMT) in Ohio. METHOD: The empirical model employed in this analysis allows for interaction effects between per capita income and highway usage, in the determination of fatality rates. RESULTS: The resultant least squares estimates indicate that a significant interaction effect exists between per capita income and the percentage of highway VMT, indicating a nonlinear correlation between per capita income and fatality rates. This correlation rises as the proportion of VMT on highways rises, such that there is an inverse relationship with fatality rates when the highway share of county VMT is low and a direct relationship with fatality rates when the highway share of county VMT is high. Additionally, population density, the presence of interstate highways in rural counties, the prior prevalence of severe alcohol abuse, and the proportion of teen drivers all proved to be significant correlates with county fatality rates. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest factors that state and federal policy makers should consider when allocating resources that impact (whether directly or indirectly) traffic fatalities.},

@article{Naghavi2010,
abstract = {Coverage and quality of cause-of-death (CoD) data varies across countries and time. Valid, reliable, and comparable assessments of trends in causes of death from even the best systems are limited by three problems: a) changes in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) over time; b) the use of tabulation lists where substantial detail on causes of death is lost; and c) many deaths assigned to causes that cannot or should not be considered underlying causes of death, often called garbage codes (GCs). The Global Burden of Disease Study and the World Health Organization have developed various methods to enhance comparability of CoD data. In this study, we attempt to build on these approaches to enhance the utility of national cause-of-death data for public health analysis. Based on careful consideration of 4,434 country-years of CoD data from 145 countries from 1901 to 2008, encompassing 743 million deaths in ICD versions 1 to 10 as well as country-specific cause lists, we have developed a public health-oriented cause-of-death list. These 56 causes are organized hierarchically and encompass all deaths. Each cause has been mapped from ICD-6 to ICD-10 and, where possible, they have also been mapped to the International List of Causes of Death 1-5. We developed a typology of different classes of GCs. In each ICD revision, GCs have been identified. Target causes to which these GCs should be redistributed have been identified based on certification practice and/or pathophysiology. Proportionate redistribution, statistical models, and expert algorithms have been developed to redistribute GCs to target codes for each age-sex group. The fraction of all deaths assigned to GCs varies tremendously across countries and revisions of the ICD. In general, across all country-years of data available, GCs have declined from more than 43{\%} in ICD-7 to 24{\%} in ICD-10. In some regions, such as Australasia, GCs in 2005 are as low as 11{\%}, while in some developing countries, such as Thailand, they are greater than 50{\%}. Across different age groups, the composition of GCs varies tremendously - three classes of GCs steadily increase with age, but ambiguous codes within a particular disease chapter are also common for injuries at younger ages. The impact of redistribution is to change the number of deaths assigned to particular causes for a given age-sex group. These changes alter ranks across countries for any given year by a number of different causes, change time trends, and alter the rank order of causes within a country. By mapping CoD through different ICD versions and redistributing GCs, we believe the public health utility of CoD data can be substantially enhanced, leading to an increased demand for higher quality CoD data from health sector decision-makers.},

abstract = {Although there are signs of decline, homicides and traffic-related injuries and deaths in Brazil account for almost two-thirds of all deaths from external causes. In 2007, the homicide rate was 26{\textperiodcentered}8 per 100,000 people and traffic-related mortality was 23{\textperiodcentered}5 per 100,000. Domestic violence might not lead to as many deaths, but its share of violence-related morbidity is large. These are important public health problems that lead to enormous individual and collective costs. Young, black, and poor men are the main victims and perpetrators of community violence, whereas poor black women and children are the main victims of domestic violence. Regional differentials are also substantial. Besides the sociocultural determinants, much of the violence in Brazil has been associated with the misuse of alcohol and illicit drugs, and the wide availability of firearms. The high traffic-related morbidity and mortality in Brazil have been linked to the chosen model for the transport system that has given priority to roads and private-car use without offering adequate infrastructure. The system is often poorly equipped to deal with violations of traffic rules. In response to the major problems of violence and injuries, Brazil has greatly advanced in terms of legislation and action plans. The main challenge is to assess these advances to identify, extend, integrate, and continue the successful ones.},

abstract = {Statistics on road traffic accidents (RTAs) mainly come from police records. The police reported RTA statistics however are known to have a large degree of under-registration, underestimating the true risk of being injured in traffic accidents. The use of medical based datasets can provide a more accurate estimate of the actual traffic accident health risk. Exposure-based rates of the actual burden from Flanders and Brussels were calculated, comparing differences between road user, age, gender and type of injury sustained. Minimal Clinical Data (MCD) was selected for the years 2003-2007, as well as data from the mortality statistics. Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) were calculated and put into perspective with the passenger kilometres travelled. Motorcyclists followed by bicyclists and pedestrians showed a higher DALY per travelled kilometre (6365, 1724 and 1359 DALY per billion kilometres respectively), compared to 113 DALY per billion kilometres for motor vehicles. In bicyclists and to lesser extent in motorcyclists, the majority of the health burden was attributed to disability following injuries and not fatalities. Also in the other road user categories disability added substantially to the total health loss. The use of medical data and more particular the MCD may be a valuable addition of those RTAs that are missed by the police scope. Although the results are still conservative estimations, an injury-based approach can help to better understand the health problem that road traffic accidents cause.},

abstract = {Background Zika virus (ZIKV) has been linked to neonatal microcephaly. To characterize the spectrum of ZIKV disease in pregnancy, we followed patients in Rio de Janeiro to describe clinical manifestations in mothers and repercussions of acute ZIKV infection in fetuses. Methods We enrolled pregnant women in whom a rash had developed within the previous 5 days and tested blood and urine specimens for ZIKV by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assays. We followed the women prospectively and collected clinical and ultrasonographic data. Results A total of 88 women were enrolled from September 2015 through February 2016; of these 88 women, 72 (82{\%}) tested positive for ZIKV in blood, urine, or both. The timing of acute ZIKV infection ranged from 5 to 38 weeks of gestation. Predominant clinical features included pruritic descending macular or maculopapular rash, arthralgias, conjunctival injection, and headache; 28{\%} had fever (short-term and low-grade). Women who were positive for ZIKV were more likely than those who were negative for the virus to have maculopapular rash (44{\%} vs. 12{\%}, P=0.02), conjunctival involvement (58{\%} vs. 13{\%}, P=0.002), and lymphadenopathy (40{\%} vs. 7{\%}, P=0.02). Fetal ultrasonography was performed in 42 ZIKV-positive women (58{\%}) and in all ZIKV-negative women. Fetal abnormalities were detected by Doppler ultrasonography in 12 of the 42 ZIKV-positive women (29{\%}) and in none of the 16 ZIKV-negative women. Adverse findings included fetal deaths at 36 and 38 weeks of gestation (2 fetuses), in utero growth restriction with or without microcephaly (5 fetuses), ventricular calcifications or other central nervous system (CNS) lesions (7 fetuses), and abnormal amniotic fluid volume or cerebral or umbilical artery flow (7 fetuses). To date, 8 of the 42 women in whom fetal ultrasonography was performed have delivered their babies, and the ultrasonographic findings have been confirmed. Conclusions Despite mild clinical symptoms, ZIKV infection during pregnancy appears to be associated with grave outcomes, including fetal death, placental insufficiency, fetal growth restriction, and CNS injury.},

abstract = {The distribution of human capital and income lies at the center of a nexus of forces that shape a country's economic, institutional and technological structure. I develop here a unified model to analyze these interactions and their growth consequences. Five main issues are addressed. First, I identify the key factors that make both European-style "welfare state" and US-style "laissez-faire" social contracts sustainable.; I also compare the growth rates of these two politico-economic steady states, which are no Pareto-rankable. Second, I examine how technological evolutions affect the set of redistributive institutions that can be durably sustained, showing in particular how skill-biased technical change may cause the welfare state to unravel. Third, I model the endogenous determination of technology or organizational form that results from firms' tailoring the flexibility of their production processes to the distribution of workers' skills. The greater is human capital heterogeneity, the more flexible and wage-disequalizing is the equilibrium technology. Moreover, firms' choices tend to generate excessive flexibility, resulting in suboptimal growth or even self- sustaining technology-inequality traps. Fourth, I examine how institutions also shape the course of technology; thus, a world-wide shift in the technology frontier results in different evolutions of production processes and skill premia across countries with different social contracts. Finally, I ask what joint configurations of technology, inequality and redistributive policy are feasible in the long run, when all three are endogenous. I show in particular how the diffusion of technology leads to the "exporting" of inequality across borders; and how this, in turn, generates spillovers between social contracts that make it more difficult for nations to maintain distinct institutions and social structures.},

abstract = {Achieving climate smart agriculture depends on understanding the links between farming and livelihood practices, other possible adaptation options, and the effects on farm performance, which is conceptualised by farmers as wider than yields. Reliable indicators of farm performance are needed in order to model these links, and to therefore be able to design interventions which meet the differing needs of specific user groups. However, the lack of standardization of performance indicators has led to a wide array of tools and ad-hoc indicators which limit our ability to compare across studies and to draw general conclusions on relationships and trade-offs whereby performance indicators are shaped by farm management and the wider social-environmental context. RHoMIS is a household survey tool designed to rapidly characterise a series of standardised indicators across the spectrum of agricultural production and market integration, nutrition, food security, poverty and GHG emissions. The survey tool takes 40–60min to administer per household using a digital implementation platform. This is linked to a set of automated analysis procedures that enable immediate cross-site bench-marking and intra-site characterisation. We trialled the survey in two contrasting agro-ecosystems, in Lushoto district of Tanzania (n=150) and in the Trifinio border region of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras (n=285). The tool rapidly characterised variability between farming systems at landscape scales in both locations identifying key differences across the population of farm households that would be critical for targeting CSA interventions. Our results suggest that at both sites the climate smartness of different farm strategies is clearly determined by an interaction between the characteristics of the farm household and the farm strategy. In general strategies that enabled production intensification contributed more towards the goals of climate smart agriculture on smaller farms, whereas increased market orientation was more successful on larger farms. On small farms off-farm income needs to be in place before interventions can be promoted successfully, whereas on the larger farms a choice is made between investing labour in off-farm incomes, or investing that labour into the farm, resulting in a negative association between off-farm labour and intensification, market orientation and crop diversity on the larger farms, which is in complete opposition to the associations found for the smaller farms. The balance of indicators selected gave an adequate snap shot picture of the two sites, and allowed us to appraise the ‘CSA-ness' of different existing farm strategies, within the context of other major development objectives.},

abstract = {The Internet has provided IS researchers with the opportunity to conduct studies with extremely large sam- ples, frequently well over 10,000 observations. There are many advantages to large samples, but researchers using statistical inference must be aware of the p-value problem associated with them. In very large samples, p-values go quickly to zero, and solely relying on p-values can lead the researcher to claim support for results of no practical significance. In a survey of large sample IS research, we found that a significant number of papers rely on a low p-value and the sign of a regression coefficient alone to support their hypotheses. This research commentary recommends a series of actions the researcher can take to mitigate the p-value problem in large samples and illustrates them with an example of over 300,000 camera sales on eBay. We believe that addressing the p-value problem will increase the credibility of large sample IS research as well as provide more insights for readers.},

abstract = {A retrospective case-control study was conducted to identify risk factors for border malaria in a malaria elimination setting of Yunnan Province, China. The study comprised 214 cases and 428 controls. The controls were individually matched to the cases on the basis of residence, age, and gender. In addition, statistical associations are based on matched analyses. The frequencies of imported, male, adult, and vivax malaria cases were respectively 201 (93.9{\%}), 194 (90.7{\%}), 210 (98.1{\%}), and 176 (82.2{\%}). Overnight stay in Myanmar within the prior month was independently associated with malaria infection (odds ratio [OR] 159.5, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 75.1-338.9). In particular, stays in lowland and foothill (OR 5.5, 95{\%} CI 2.5-11.8) or mid-hill (OR 42.8, 95{\%} CI 5.1-319.8) areas, or near streamlets (OR 15.3, 95{\%} CI 4.3-55.2) or paddy field or pools (OR10.1, 95{\%} CI 4.4-55.8) were found to be independently associated with malaria. Neither forest exposure nor use of vector control measures was associated with malaria. In conclusion, travel to lowland and foothill or mid-hill hyperendemic areas, especially along the waterside in Myanmar, was found to be the highest risk factor for malaria. In considering the limitations of the study, further investigations are needed to identify the major determinants of malaria risk and develop new strategies for malaria elimination on China-Myanmar border.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The Epidemiological Surveillance System for Malaria (SIVEP-Malaria) is the Brazilian governmental program that registers all information about compulsory reporting of detected cases of malaria by all medical units and medical practitioners. The objective of this study is to point out the main sources of errors in the SIVEP-Malaria database by applying a data cleaning method to assist researchers about the best way to use it and to report the problems to authorities. The aim of this study was to assess the quality of the data collected by the surveillance system and its accuracy. The SIVEP-Malaria data base used was for the state of Amazonas, Brazil, with data collected from 2003 to 2014. A data cleaning method was applied to the database to detect and remove erroneous records. It was observed that the collecting procedure of the database is not homogeneous among the municipalities and over the years. Some of the variables had different data collection periods, missing data, outliers and inconsistencies. Variables depending on the health agents showed a good quality but those that rely on patients were often inaccurate. We showed that a punctilious preprocessing is needed to produce statistically correct data from the SIVEP-Malaria data base. Fine spatial scale and multi-temporal analysis are of particular concern due to the local concentration of uncertainties and the data collecting seasonality observed. This assessment should help to enhance the quality of studies and the monitoring of the use of the SIVEP database.},

abstract = {RESUMO: Objetivo: Analisar as taxas de mortalidade e as principais causas de morte na inf{\^{a}}ncia no Brasil e estados, entre 1990 e 2015, utilizando estimativas do estudo Carga Global de Doen{\c{c}}a (Global Burden of Disease - GBD) 2015. M{\'{e}}todos: As fontes de dados foram {\'{o}}bitos e nascimentos estimados com base nos dados do Sistema de Informa{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es sobre Mortalidade (SIM), censos e pesquisas. Foram calculadas propor{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es e taxas por mil nascidos vivos (NV) para o total de {\'{o}}bitos e as principais causas de morte na inf{\^{a}}ncia. Resultados: O n{\'{u}}mero estimado de {\'{o}}bitos para menores de 5 anos, no Brasil, foi de 191.505, em 1990, e 51.226, em 2015, sendo cerca de 90{\%} mortes infantis. A taxa de mortalidade na inf{\^{a}}ncia no Brasil sofreu redu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de 67,6{\%}, entre 1990 e 2015, cumprindo a meta estabelecida nos Objetivos de Desenvolvimento do Mil{\^{e}}nio (ODM). A redu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o total das taxas foi, em geral, acima de 60{\%} nos estados, sendo maior na regi{\~{a}}o Nordeste. A disparidade entre as regi{\~{o}}es foi reduzida, sendo que a raz{\~{a}}o entre o estado com a maior e a menor taxa diminuiu de 4,9, em 1990, para 2,3, em 2015. A prematuridade, apesar de queda de 72{\%} nas taxas, figurou como a principal causa de {\'{o}}bito em ambos os anos, seguida da doen{\c{c}}a diarreica, em 1990, e das anomalias cong{\^{e}}nitas, da asfixia no parto e da sepse neonatal, em 2015. Conclus{\~{a}}o: A queda nas taxas de mortalidade na inf{\^{a}}ncia representa um importante ganho no per{\'{i}}odo, com redu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de disparidades geogr{\'{a}}ficas. As causas relacionadas ao cuidado em sa{\'{u}}de na gesta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, no parto e no nascimento figuram como as principais em 2015, em conjunto com as anomalias cong{\^{e}}nitas. Pol{\'{i}}ticas p{\'{u}}blicas intersetoriais e de sa{\'{u}}de espec{\'{i}}ficas devem ser aprimoradas.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Great strides have been made exploring and exploiting new and different sources of disease surveillance data and developing robust statistical methods for analyzing the collected data. However, there has been less research in the area of dissemination. Proper dissemination of surveillance data can facilitate the end user's taking of appropriate actions, thus maximizing the utility of effort taken from upstream of the surveillance-to-action loop.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: The aims of the study were to develop a generic framework for a digital dashboard incorporating features of efficient dashboard design and to demonstrate this framework by specific application to influenza surveillance in Hong Kong.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Based on the merits of the national websites and principles of efficient dashboard design, we designed an automated influenza surveillance digital dashboard as a demonstration of efficient dissemination of surveillance data. We developed the system to synthesize and display multiple sources of influenza surveillance data streams in the dashboard. Different algorithms can be implemented in the dashboard for incorporating all surveillance data streams to describe the overall influenza activity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We designed and implemented an influenza surveillance dashboard that utilized self-explanatory figures to display multiple surveillance data streams in panels. Indicators for individual data streams as well as for overall influenza activity were summarized in the main page, which can be read at a glance. Data retrieval function was also incorporated to allow data sharing in standard format.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The influenza surveillance dashboard serves as a template to illustrate the efficient synthesization and dissemination of multiple-source surveillance data, which may also be applied to other diseases. Surveillance data from multiple sources can be disseminated efficiently using a dashboard design that facilitates the translation of surveillance information to public health actions.},

abstract = {This article examines the trends of road traffic crash (RTC) fatality rates in OECD countries over the past four decades. Based on recent developments in the economic growth literature we propose and test the hypothesis that RTC fatality rates initially increase with economic development, peak, and then gradually decrease. The theory predicts that, as a result, the RTC fatality rates of different countries will tend to converge over time. Our results for the period 1961-2007 reveal no evidence of the convergence of RTC fatality rates across the OECD as a whole for that time period. Nevertheless, there is evidence of convergence among sub-groups of countries. This evidence may assist policymakers as an additional way of benchmarking their country's performance against that of its peers and to identify the next-closest peer in country sub-groups with superior road safety performance.},

abstract = {The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic provides a unique opportunity for detailed examination of the spatial dynamics of an emerging pathogen. In the US, the pandemic was characterized by substantial geographical heterogeneity: the 2009 spring wave was limited mainly to northeastern cities while the larger fall wave affected the whole country. Here we use finely resolved spatial and temporal influenza disease data based on electronic medical claims to explore the spread of the fall pandemic wave across 271 US cities and associated suburban areas. We document a clear spatial pattern in the timing of onset of the fall wave, starting in southeastern cities and spreading outwards over a period of three months. We use mechanistic models to tease apart the external factors associated with the timing of the fall wave arrival: differential seeding events linked to demographic factors, school opening dates, absolute humidity, prior immunity from the spring wave, spatial diffusion, and their interactions. Although the onset of the fall wave was correlated with school openings as previously reported, models including spatial spread alone resulted in better fit. The best model had a combination of the two. Absolute humidity or prior exposure during the spring wave did not improve the fit and population size only played a weak role. In conclusion, the protracted spread of pandemic influenza in fall 2009 in the US was dominated by short-distance spatial spread partially catalysed by school openings rather than long-distance transmission events. This is in contrast to the rapid hierarchical transmission patterns previously described for seasonal influenza. The findings underline the critical role that school-age children play in facilitating the geographic spread of pandemic influenza and highlight the need for further information on the movement and mixing patterns of this age group.},

abstract = {The exponentially increasing str eam of real time big data produced by Web 2.0 Internet and mobile networks created radically new interdisciplinary challenges for public health and computer science. Traditional pub lic health disease surveillance systems have to utilize the potential created by new situation- aware realtime signals from social media, mobile/sensor networks and citizens' participatory surveillance systems providing invaluable free realtime event-based signals for epidemic intelligence. However, rather than improving existing isolated systems, an integrated solution bringing together existing epidemic intelligence systems scanning news media (e.g., GPHIN, MedISys) with real-time social media intelligence (e.g., Twitter, participatory system s) is required to substantially improve and automate early wa rning, outbreak detection and preparedness operations. Howeve r, automatic monitoring and novel verification methods for these multichannel event-based real time signals has to be inte grated with traditional case-based surveillance systems from microbiological laboratories and clinical reporting. Finally, the system needs effectively support coordination of epidemiological teams, risk communication with citizens and implementation of prevention measures. However, from computational pe rspective, signal detection, analysis and verification of very high noise realtime big data provide a number of interdiscip linary challenges for computer science. Novel approaches integrating current systems into a digital public health dashboard can enhance signal verification methods and automate the pro cesses assisting public health experts in providing better inform ed and more timely response. In this paper, we describe the roadmap to such a system, components of an integrated public health surveillance services and computing challenges to be resolved to create an integrated real world solution.},

abstract = {The ecologic study design is routinely used by epidemiologists in spite of its limitations. It is presently unknown how well the challenges of the design are dealt with in epidemiologic research. The purpose of this bibliometric review was to critically evaluate the characteristics, statistical methods, and reporting of results of modern cross-sectional ecologic papers. A search through 6 major epidemiology journals identified all cross-sectional ecologic studies published since January 1, 2000. A total of 125 articles met the inclusion requirements and were assessed via common evaluative criteria. It was found that a considerable number of cross-sectional ecologic studies use unreliable methods or contain statistical oversights; most investigators who adjusted their outcomes for age or sex did so improperly (64{\%}), statistical validity was a potential issue for 20{\%} of regression models, and simple linear regression was the most common analytic approach (31{\%}). Many authors omitted important information when discussing the ecologic nature of their study (31{\%}), the choice of study design (58{\%}), and the susceptibility of their research to the ecological fallacy (49{\%}). These results suggest that there is a need for an international set of guidelines that standardizes reporting on ecologic studies. Additionally, greater attention should be given to the relevant biostatistical literature.},

abstract = {Background: Malaria is endemic in French Guiana, an overseas territory of France on the Guiana Shield. Since 2005, notified malaria cases are decreasing. However, new data show that malaria affects many Brazilian gold miners work-ing illegally in French Guiana, the majority of whom are not counted in official data. In addition, one major concern is the usual practice of improper self-treatment in this mining population, raising fear of the development of anti-malarial resistance. This prospective study, conducted in 2015, aimed to estimate the prevalence of Plasmodium spp. in illegal gold miners working in French Guiana. Methods: The recruitment of gold miners was carried out in resting sites along the French Guiana-Suriname border, where they go for supplies, medical care or leisure. After recording agreement, three malaria diagnostic methods were performed: rapid diagnostic test, microscopy and PCR. Results: Among 421 persons recruited in the study, malaria prevalence, detected by nested-PCR, was 22.3 {\%} (CI [18.3–26.3], n = 94/421) of which 84 {\%} were asymptomatic. Conclusions: This significant malaria reservoir in a mobile and illegal population with difficult access to a health care system raises the threat of artemisinin resistance and puts the population of the Guiana Shield at risk of new transmis-sion foci while countries of the region aim at malaria elimination. Even though French legislation may hamper dealing with this population, France must face the reality of malaria in illegal gold miners in order to meet its commitment to malaria elimination.},

abstract = {The seven contributions in this book examine the potential impact of a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico on the U.S. economy. They cover such key aspects as the general sources of comparative advantage between Mexico and the U.S., regional and local effects on production and employment, and the effect on production in particular industries. The authors start from the premise that the trade agreement will have a small impact on the overall U.S. gross national product because the U.S. economy is large compared to that of Mexico and because there is already much unrestricted trade between the two countries. Several chapters consider how some sources of comparative advantage that cut across industries differential environmental regulations and wage differentials - may affect the outcome. These are followed by chapters that assess the locational effects on U.S. production, either from the viewpoint of which metropolitan areas will gain employment or of the scale effects-transportation cost-tradeoff. Concluding chapters address the effect of the NAFTA on several individual U.S. sectors such as agriculture, automobiles, and financial services. Peter M. Garber is Professor of Economics at Brown University. A reduction in trade barriers generally will affect the environment by expanding the scale of economic activity, by altering the composition of economic activity, and by bringing about a change in the techniques of production. We present empirical evidence to assess the relative magnitudes of these three effects as they apply to further trade liberalization in Mexico. In Section 1. we use comparable measures of three air pollutants in a cross-section of urban areas located in 42 countries to study the relationship between air quality and economic growth. We find for two pollutants (sulfur dioxide and "smoke") that concentrations increase with per capita GDP at low levels of national income, but decrease with GD? growth at higher levels of income. Section 2 studies the determinants of the industry pattern of U.S. imports from Mexico and of value added by Mexico's maquiladora sector. We investigate whether the size of pollution abatement costs in the U.S. industry influences the pattern of international trade and investment. Finally, in Section 3, we use the results from a computable general equilibrium model to study the likely compositional effect of a NAFTA on pollution in Mexico.},

@article{Erdogan2009,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study is to describe the inter-province differences in traffic accidents and mortality on roads of Turkey.

METHOD: Two different risk indicators were used to evaluate the road safety performance of the provinces in Turkey. These indicators are the ratios between the number of persons killed in road traffic accidents (1) and the number of accidents (2) (nominators) and their exposure to traffic risk (denominator). Population and the number of registered motor vehicles in the provinces were used as denominators individually. Spatial analyses were performed to the mean annual rate of deaths and to the number of fatal accidents that were calculated for the period of 2001-2006. Empirical Bayes smoothing was used to remove background noise from the raw death and accident rates because of the sparsely populated provinces and small number of accident and death rates of provinces. Global and local spatial autocorrelation analyses were performed to show whether the provinces with high rates of deaths-accidents show clustering or are located closer by chance. The spatial distribution of provinces with high rates of deaths and accidents was nonrandom and detected as clustered with significance of P{\textless}0.05 with spatial autocorrelation analyses.

RESULTS: Regions with high concentration of fatal accidents and deaths were located in the provinces that contain the roads connecting the Istanbul, Ankara, and Antalya provinces. Accident and death rates were also modeled with some independent variables such as number of motor vehicles, length of roads, and so forth using geographically weighted regression analysis with forward step-wise elimination. The level of statistical significance was taken as P{\textless}0.05. Large differences were found between the rates of deaths and accidents according to denominators in the provinces. The geographically weighted regression analyses did significantly better predictions for both accident rates and death rates than did ordinary least regressions, as indicated by adjusted R(2) values. Geographically weighted regression provided values of 0.89-0.99 adjusted R(2) for death and accident rates, compared with 0.88-0.95, respectively, by ordinary least regressions.

IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: Geographically weighted regression has the potential to reveal local patterns in the spatial distribution of rates, which would be ignored by the ordinary least regression approach. The application of spatial analysis and modeling of accident statistics and death rates at provincial level in Turkey will help to identification of provinces with outstandingly high accident and death rates. This could help more efficient road safety management in Turkey.},

abstract = {There are limited published data on recent cancer incidence and mortality trends worldwide. We used the International Agency for Research on Cancer's CANCERMondial clearinghouse to present age-standardized cancer incidence and death rates for 2003-2007. We also present trends in incidence through 2007 and mortality through 2012 for select countries from five continents. High-income countries (HIC) continue to have the highest incidence rates for all sites, as well as for lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer, although some low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) now count among those with the highest rates. Mortality rates from these cancers are declining in many HICs while they are increasing in LMICs. LMICs have the highest rates of stomach, liver, esophageal, and cervical cancer. Although rates remain high in HICs, they are plateauing or decreasing for the most common cancers due to decreases in known risk factors, screening and early detection, and improved treatment (mortality only). In contrast, rates in several LMICs are increasing for these cancers due to increases in smoking, excess body weight, and physical inactivity. LMICs also have a disproportionate burden of infection-related cancers. Applied cancer control measures are needed to reduce rates in HICs and arrest the growing burden in LMICs.Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 1-12. {\textcopyright}2015 AACR.See related commentary by Bray, p.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate integrity of access to uterine cervical cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment services. METHODS: The tracer condition was analyzed using a mixed quantitative and qualitative approach. The quantitative approach was based on secondary data from the analysis of cytology and biopsy exams performed between 2008 and 2010 on 25 to 59 year-old women in a municipality with a large population and with the necessary technological resources. Data were obtained from the Health Information System and the Regional Cervical Cancer Information System. Statistical analysis was performed using PASW statistic 17.0 software. The qualitative approach involved semi-structured interviews with service managers, health care professionals and users. NVivo 9.0 software was used for the content analysis of the primary data. RESULTS: Pap smear coverage was low, possible due to insufficient screening and the difficulty of making appointments in primary care. The numbers of biopsies conducted are similar to those of abnormal cytologies, reflecting easy access to the specialized services. There was higher coverage among younger women. More serious diagnoses, for both cytologies and biopsies, were more prevalent in older women. CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient coverage of cytologies, reported by the interviewees allows us to understand access difficulties in primary care, as well as the fragility of screening strategies.},

abstract = {Health research generates knowledge that can be utilized to improve health system performance and, ultimately, health and health equity. We propose a conceptual framework for health research systems (HRSs) that defines their boundaries, components, goals, and functions. The framework adopts a systems perspective towards HRSs and serves as a foundation for constructing a practical approach to describe and analyse HRSs. The analysis of HRSs should, in turn, provide a better understanding of how research contributes to gains in health and health equity. In this framework, the intrinsic goals of the HRS are the advancement of scientific knowledge and the utilization of knowledge to improve health and health equity. Its four principal functions are stewardship, financing, creating and sustaining resources, and producing and using research. The framework, as it is applied in consultation with countries, will provide countries and donor agencies with relevant inputs to policies and strategies for strengthening HRSs and using knowledge for better health.

abstract = {Web surveys are becoming increasingly popular in survey research including stated preference surveys. Compared with face-to-face, telephone and mail surveys, web surveys may contain a different and new source of measurement error and bias: the type of device that respondents use to answer the survey questions. This is the first study that tests whether the use of mobile devices, tablets or smartphones, affects survey characteristics and stated preferences in a web-based choice experiment. The web survey on expanding renewable energy production in Germany was carried out with 3182 respondents, of which 12{\%} used a mobile device. Propensity score matching is used to account for selection bias in the use of mobile devices for survey completion. We find that mobile device users spent more time than desktop/laptop users to answer the survey. Yet, desktop/laptop users and mobile device users do not differ in acquiescence tendency as an indicator of extreme response patterns. For mobile device users only, we find a negative correlation between screen size and interview length and a positive correlation between screen size and acquiescence tendency. In the choice experiment data, we do not find significant differences in the tendency to choose the status quo option and scale between both subsamples. However, some of the estimates of implicit prices differ, albeit not in a unidirectional fashion. Model results for mobile device users indicate a U-shaped relationship between error variance and screen size. Together, the results suggest that using mobile devices is not detrimental to survey quality.},

The proposed system applies a combination of two methods of artificial immune and genetic algorithm to diagnose the liver disease. The system architecture is based on artificial immune system. The learning procedure of system adopts genetic algorithm to interfere the evolution of antibody population. The experiments use two benchmark datasets in our study, which are acquired from the famous UCI machine learning repository.

abstract = {The World Health Report 2013 provides a major boost to the health research community and, in particular, to those who believe that health research will make its greatest impact on improving health when it is organised through a systems approach. The World Health Report 2013, Research for Universal Health Coverage, starts with three key messages. Firstly, that universal health coverage, with full access to high-quality services, needs research evidence if it is to be achieved; second, all nations should conduct and use research; and finally, the report states that systems are needed to develop national research agendas, to raise funds, to strengthen research capacity, and to make effective use of research findings. Each of these themes is elaborated in the report and supported by extensive references.In this editorial, we first outline the key messages from the World Health Report 2013 and highlight the contributions made by papers from our journal, Health Research Policy and Systems. In addition, we discuss very recent papers that advance some issues even further. In particular, we consider new evidence both on how to achieve financial protection for those who use health services, and on whether healthcare professionals and organisations who engage in research provide an improved healthcare performance. Finally, we propose additional perspectives that add to the impressive body of evidence and analyses presented in the report. Specifically, we suggest that considering the needs of various stakeholders, as attempted in the UK, in parallel with analysing how to fulfil essential functions, should boost the prospects of successfully building and strengthening health research systems. This is important because research is vital for achieving universal health coverage, and consequently for improving the health of millions of people.},

abstract = {Despite the hype around data analytics, the success rate of analytics initiatives remains very low and the value of data in organisations is left hidden. Various research studies show that the main barriers to analytics adoption are organisational and the lack of structured approaches on how to conduct analytics initiatives is a possible cause of analytics project failures. Data mining process models then become fundamental means to support analytics project management and minimise the risk of data dredging. In this paper, Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining process models are reviewed starting from the most popular models currently in use. Four distinctive research paths for data mining process models have emerged. These evolution paths seem to address limitations of the CRISP–DM model which remains the de facto standard in industry. The research streams identified include the evolution of the human role; the relevance of iteration and interactions; the role of data and knowledge repositories; and the integration of software engineering/agile methodologies. In the future, these four research streams should be combined to support the development of more encompassing process models. },

abstract = {Objectives: To review research published before and after the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010) examining barriers in seeking or accessing health care in rural populations in the USA. Study design: This literature review was based on a comprehensive search for all literature researching rural health care provision and access in the USA. Methods: Pubmed, Proquest Allied Nursing and Health Literature, National Rural Health Association (NRHA) Resource Center and Google Scholar databases were searched using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) 'Rural Health Services' and 'Rural Health.' MeSH subtitle headings used were 'USA,' 'utilization,' 'trends' and 'supply and distribution.' Keywords added to the search parameters were 'access,' 'rural' and 'health care.' Searches in Google Scholar employed the phrases 'health care disparities in the USA,' inequalities in 'health care in the USA,' 'health care in rural USA' and 'access to health care in rural USA.' After eliminating non-relevant articles, 34 articles were included. Results: Significant differences in health care access between rural and urban areas exist. Reluctance to seek health care in rural areas was based on cultural and financial constraints, often compounded by a scarcity of services, a lack of trained physicians, insufficient public transport, and poor availability of broadband internet services. Rural residents were found to have poorer health, with rural areas having difficulty in attracting and retaining physicians, and maintaining health services on a par with their urban counterparts. Conclusions: Rural and urban health care disparities require an ongoing program of reform with the aim to improve the provision of services, promote recruitment, training and career development of rural health care professionals, increase comprehensive health insurance coverage and engage rural residents and healthcare providers in health promotion.},

abstract = {The objective of this research was to determine the extent to which the decline in alcohol-related highway deaths among drivers younger than age 21 years can be attributed to raising the minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) and establishing zero tolerance (0.02{\%} blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit for drivers younger than age 21 years) laws. Data on all drivers younger than age 21 years involved in fatalities in the United States from 1982 to 1997 were used in the study. Quarterly ratios of BAC-positive to BAC-negative drivers in each of the 50 states where analyzed in a pooled cross-sectional time-series analysis. After accounting for differences among the 50 states in various background factors, changes in economic and demographic factors within states over time, and the effects of other related laws, results indicated substantial reductions in alcohol-positive involvement in fatal crashes were associated with the two youth-specific laws. The policy of limiting youth access to alcohol through MLDA laws and reinforcing this action by making it illegal for underage drivers to have any alcohol in their system appears to have been effective in reducing the proportion of fatal crashes involving drinking drivers. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Geographical Information System (GIS) technology has been a popular tool for visualization of accident data and analysis of hot spots in highways. Many traffic agencies have been using GIS for accident analysis. Accident analysis studies aim at the identification of high rate accident locations and safety deficient areas on the highways. So, traffic officials can implement precautionary measures and provisions for traffic safety. Since accident reports are prepared in textual format in Turkey, this situation makes it difficult to analyze accident results. In our study, we developed a system transforming these textual data to tabular form and then this tabular data were georeferenced onto the highways. Then, the hot spots in the highways in Afyonkarahisar administrative border were explored and determined with two different methods of Kernel Density analysis and repeatability analysis. Subsequently, accident conditions at these hot spots were examined. We realized that the hot spots determined with two methods reflect really problematic places such as cross roads, junction points etc. Many of previous studies introduced GIS only as a visualization tool for accident locations. The importance of this study was to use GIS as a management system for accident analysis and determination of hot spots in Turkey with statistical analysis methods.},

abstract = {Road safety developments are correlated with mobility developments, which are in turn affected by socioeconomic factors (level of motorisation, economic growth etc.). During the last few years, road traffic fatalities exhibit important annual reductions in several developed countries; these reductions cannot be justified by policy efforts alone, and are partly attributed to the global economic recession affecting most countries' economy and mobility. The present research aims to associate annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) changes with the related annual changes in road traffic mortality rates. Mortality rates and GDP per capita data for the period 1975–2011 are used from 27 European countries, for the development of mixed linear models. The results suggest that an annual increase of GDP per capita leads to an annual increase of mortality rates, whereas an annual decrease of GDP per capita leads to an annual decrease of mortality rates. These effects are statistically significant overall, and in different groups of countries (Northern/Western, Central/Eastern and Southern). A one-year lagged effect of annual GDP decrease was found to be significant in Northern/Western countries. These effects may capture annual GDP increases from the improvement in the prosperity level of most European countries, as well as occasional annual GDP decreases as a result of socioeconomic events (e.g. economic recessions, political changes in Central/Eastern European countries in the early nineties etc.). The models proposed in this paper are able to characterise the short-term dynamics of the examined variables, but not their long-run relationships.},

Such methods go well beyond the conventional 'nearest-neighbour' and 'quadrat' analyses which have little to offer in an epidemiological context because they fail to allow for spatial variation in population density. Correction for this is essential if the aim is to assess the evidence for 'clustering' of cases of disease. We examine methods for exploring spatial variation in disease risk, spatial and space-time clustering, and we consider methods for modelling the raised incidence of disease around suspected point sources of pollution. All methods are illustrated by reference to recent case studies including child cancer incidence, Burkitt's lymphoma, cancer of the larynx and childhood asthma. An Appendix considers a range of possible software environments within which to apply these methods. The links to modern geographical information systems are discussed.},

abstract = {Background Substantial molecular evidence suggests a role for human papillomavirus (HPV) in the pathogenesis of oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinoma, but epidemiologic data have been inconsistent. Methods We performed a hospital-based, case–control study of 100 patients with newly diagnosed oropharyngeal cancer and 200 control patients without cancer to evaluate associations between HPV infection and oropharyngeal cancer. Multivariate logisticregression models were used for case–control comparisons. Results A high lifetime number of vaginal-sex partners (26 or more) was associated with oropharyngeal cancer (odds ratio, 3.1; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.5 to 6.5), as was a high lifetime number of oral-sex partners (6 or more) (odds ratio, 3.4; 95{\%} CI, 1.3 to 8.8). The degree of association increased with the number of vaginal-sex and oral-sex partners (P values for trend, 0.002 and 0.009, respectively). Oropharyngeal cancer was significantly associated with oral HPV type 16 (HPV-16) infection (odds ratio, 14.6; 95{\%} CI, 6.3 to 36.6), oral infection with any of 37 types of HPV (odds ratio, 12.3; 95{\%} CI, 5.4 to 26.4), and seropositivity for the HPV-16 L1 capsid protein (odds ratio, 32.2; 95{\%} CI, 14.6 to 71.3). HPV-16 DNA was detected in 72{\%} (95{\%} CI, 62 to 81) of 100 paraffin-embedded tumor specimens, and 64{\%} of patients with cancer were seropositive for the HPV-16 oncoprotein E6, E7, or both. HPV-16 L1 seropositivity was highly associated with oropharyngeal cancer among subjects with a history of heavy tobacco and alcohol use (odds ratio, 19.4; 95{\%} CI, 3.3 to 113.9) and among those without such a history (odds ratio, 33.6; 95{\%} CI, 13.3 to 84.8). The association was similarly increased among subjects with oral HPV-16 infection, regardless of their tobacco and alcohol use. By contrast, tobacco and alcohol use increased the association with oropharyngeal cancer primarily among subjects without exposure to HPV-16. Conclusions Oral HPV infection is strongly associated with oropharyngeal cancer among subjects with or without the established risk factors of tobacco and alcohol use.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility of using statistical text classification to automatically identify health information technology (HIT) incidents in the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. DESIGN: We used a subset of 570 272 incidents including 1534 HIT incidents reported to MAUDE between 1 January 2008 and 1 July 2010. Text classifiers using regularized logistic regression were evaluated with both 'balanced' (50{\%} HIT) and 'stratified' (0.297{\%} HIT) datasets for training, validation, and testing. Dataset preparation, feature extraction, feature selection, cross-validation, classification, performance evaluation, and error analysis were performed iteratively to further improve the classifiers. Feature-selection techniques such as removing short words and stop words, stemming, lemmatization, and principal component analysis were examined. MEASUREMENTS: kappa statistic, F1 score, precision and recall. RESULTS: Classification performance was similar on both the stratified (0.954 F1 score) and balanced (0.995 F1 score) datasets. Stemming was the most effective technique, reducing the feature set size to 79{\%} while maintaining comparable performance. Training with balanced datasets improved recall (0.989) but reduced precision (0.165). CONCLUSIONS: Statistical text classification appears to be a feasible method for identifying HIT reports within large databases of incidents. Automated identification should enable more HIT problems to be detected, analyzed, and addressed in a timely manner. Semi-supervised learning may be necessary when applying machine learning to big data analysis of patient safety incidents and requires further investigation.},

We argue that most existing temporal detection methods for biosurveillance can be characterized as a forecasting component coupled with a monitoring/detection component. In this paper, we describe the effect of forecast accuracy on detection performance. Quantifying this effect allows one to measure the benefits of improved forecasting and determine when it is worth improving a forecast method's precision at the cost of robustness or simplicity. We quantify the effect of forecast accuracy on detection metrics under different scenarios and investigate the effect when standard assumptions are violated. We illustrate our results by examining performance on authentic biosurveillance data. ?? 2008 International Institute of Forecasters.},

New techniques are introduced for improved evaluation and distinguish cardiac disease affected patients from the healthy controls. Experiments are conducted with high level of error tolerance rate and confidence level at 95{\%} and 99{\%} and established the results with corrected T-tests based on comparison of various performance measures. Normal kernel density estimator is used for visual distinction of cardiac controls. A new ensemble learning method comprising of Bayesian network as classifier and Principal components method as the projection filter with ranker search is used for the relevant feature selection. Analysis of each model is performed and discusses major findings and concludes with promising results compared to the related works. Multiple Correspondence analysis is used for exploring heart disease variable's relationships. Robust machine learning algorithms used are Rotation forests, MultiBoosting, Sparse multinomial logistic regression for better performance with fine tuning of their involved parameters. The work aims at improving the software reliability and quality of diagnosis of cardiac disease with robust inference system. To the best of our knowledge, from the literature survey, experimental results presented in this work show best results with supportive statistical inference.},

abstract = {Background Women who live distant from the closest subspecialty treatment center are at risk of failing to utilize high-quality care for gynecologic cancers. There has not yet been a comprehensive, national investigation of populations affected by geographic barriers to gynecologic cancer care. Methods Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were used to identify United States counties farther than 50 miles from the closest gynecologic oncologist, and hospital referral regions (HRRs) that do not contain the primary professional address of at least one gynecologic oncologist. US Census data were used to analyze counties' demographic characteristics. County-level cancer incidence was estimated using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's State Cancer Profiles. Results Thirty-six percent (1125/3143) of counties are further than 50 miles from the nearest gynecologic oncologist. A total of 14.8 million women live in low-access counties (LACs). Annually, approximately 7663 women with gynecologic cancers may experience geography-related disparities in access. Residents of LACs have lower median household income, are more likely to be White and/or Hispanic, and less likely to be Black. Forty percent (123/306) of HRRs do not contain the primary address of a gynecologic oncologist. Conclusions Approximately 9{\%} of the female population of the United States may experience geographic barriers to access high-quality care for gynecologic malignancies. Future investigations should assess whether residents of low-access counties utilize high-quality care less often, and whether there is a disparity in clinical outcomes. Disparities might be addressed by ensuring subspecialty care in low-access regions, and/or adjusting system structures to minimize the burdens of traveling long distances for cancer care.},

abstract = {Growth models with endogenous mortality assume generally that life expectancy is increasing with output per capita and, thus, with individual consumption, whatever its level is. However, empirical evidence supports a U-shaped relationship between consumption and mortality, implying that the monotonicity of that relation is local but not global. This paper develops a two-period OLG model where life expectancy is a non-monotone function of consumption, and where agents form myopic anticipations about life expectancy. The existence, uniqueness and stability of steady-state equilibria are studied. It is shown that overconsumption equilibria — i.e. equilibria at which consumption exceeds the level maximizing life expectancy — exist in highly productive economies with a low impatience. We identify also conditions under which there exist long-run cycles in output and longevity around overconsumption equilibria.},

abstract = {The aim was to examine the effect of geographical access to treatment services on cancer treatment patterns. Records for patients in northern England with breast, colon, rectal, lung, ovary and prostate tumours were augmented with estimates of travel time to the nearest hospital providing surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Using logistic regression to adjust for age, sex, tumour stage, selected tumour pathology characteristics and deprivation of place of residence, the likelihood of receiving radiotherapy was reduced for all sites studied with increasing travel time to the nearest radiotherapy hospital. Lung cancer patients living further from a thoracic surgery hospital were less likely to receive surgery, and both lung cancer and rectal cancer patients were less likely to receive chemotherapy if they lived distant from these services. Services provided in only a few specialised centres, involving longer than average patient journeys, all showed an inverse association between travel time and treatment take-up. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a decision support system to identify patients at high risk for hyperlactatemia based upon routinely measured vital signs and laboratory studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic health records of 741 adult patients at the University of California Davis Health System who met at least two systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria were used to associate patients' vital signs, white blood cell count (WBC), with sepsis occurrence and mortality. Generative and discriminative classification (na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, support vector machines, Gaussian mixture models, hidden Markov models) were used to integrate heterogeneous patient data and form a predictive tool for the inference of lactate level and mortality risk. RESULTS: An accuracy of 0.99 and discriminability of 1.00 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for lactate level prediction was obtained when the vital signs and WBC measurements were analysed in a 24 h time bin. An accuracy of 0.73 and discriminability of 0.73 AUC for mortality prediction in patients with sepsis was achieved with only three features: median of lactate levels, mean arterial pressure, and median absolute deviation of the respiratory rate. DISCUSSION: This study introduces a new scheme for the prediction of lactate levels and mortality risk from patient vital signs and WBC. Accurate prediction of both these variables can drive the appropriate response by clinical staff and thus may have important implications for patient health and treatment outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Effective predictions of lactate levels and mortality risk can be provided with a few clinical variables when the temporal aspect and variability of patient data are considered.},

Increasingly, surveillance systems are capturing spatial and temporal data on disease and health outcomes in a variety of public health contexts. A vast and growing suite of methods exists for detection of outbreaks and trends in surveillance data and the selection of appropriate methods in a given surveillance context is not always clear. While most reviews of methods focus on algorithm performance, in practice, a variety of factors determine what methods are appropriate for surveillance. In this review, we focus on the role of contextual factors such as scale, scope, surveillance objective, disease characteristics, and technical issues in relation to commonly used approaches to surveillance. Methods are classified as testing-based or model-based approaches. Reviewing methods in the context of factors other than algorithm performance highlights important aspects of implementing and selecting appropriate disease surveillance methods.},

abstract = {This paper analyses UK cycling policy in relation to the shift towards a hollowed-out neoliberal state. In the UK, cycling became embedded in public policy only after policy-making had been variously outsourced to private, quasi-private, and voluntary organisations. The paper argues that this broader context has contributed to the ongoing failure to treat cycling as a strategically important mode meriting substantial national transport funding. Secondly, the paper makes links between a growing policy focus on ‘active' and ‘responsible' citizenship, and the dispersal of cycling policy away from transport into other areas including public health and the environment. It is argued that while there are benefits to this construct, it has again helped to maintain cycling as perceived as being peripheral to the main business of ‘transport'. Cycling policy has been doubly devolved, away from the state, and away from transport. The implications of this for policy and advocacy are discussed and future directions for both are finally outlined.},

Next, we analyze this research, developing a set of dimensions along which network studies vary, including direction of causality, levels of analysis, explanatory goals, and explanatory mechanisms. We use the latter two dimensions to construct a 2-by-2 table cross-classifying studies of network consequences into four canonical types: structural social capital, social access to resources, contagion, and environmental shaping. We note the rise in popularity of studies with a greater sense of agency than was traditional in network research. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Cancer, particularly when it affects women and reproductive health, epitomizes the complexities and inequities of the epidemiological challenge faced by low- and middle-income countries. Women in resource-poor settings face a double cancer burden: the backlog of preventable cancer, and the emerging challenge of cancers that cannot be prevented but whose impact could be dramatically reduced through early detection and treatment. Disparities in cancer incidence, mortality, and other health and non-health outcomes are exacerbated by gender inequity and compounded by discrimination and stigma. The combination of these barriers implies a multiplicative challenge for women who face cancer, particularly when the disease is associated with reproduction. The horizons of maternal and reproductive health should extend to include the life cycle of healthy changes and illness that are embodied in longer life for women. Numerous opportunities exist to strengthen health systems through sexual and reproductive and women and health platforms and better meet the challenge of cancer. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.},

abstract = {Zika virus (transmitted by mosquitoes) reached French Polynesia for the first time in 2013, leading to an epidemic affecting 10{\%} of the total population. So far, it has not been known to induce any neurological complications, but, a few weeks after the outbreak, an unexpectedly high number of 42 patients presented with Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome.We report the clinical and electrophysiological characteristics of this series. Males predominated with a sex ratio of 2.82 (mean age: 46). All patients (except 2) were native Polynesian. At admission, 55{\%} were able to walk unaided against 38{\%} at nadir, 24{\%} had swallowing troubles (nadir: 45{\%}), 74{\%} had motor weakness of the limbs (nadir: 86{\%}) and deep tendon reflexes were diminished or not found in the vast majority of patients. Mean duration of the progressive phase and of the plateau phase was respectively 7 and 9 days. Thirty-eight percent of the patients were admitted in intensive care unit and 10 patients underwent tracheotomy. Nerve electrophysiological studies at admission showed marked distal motor conduction alterations, which had almost completely disappeared at the 4th month; this pattern was more suggestive of acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) than of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP). Lumbar puncture showed elevated proteins in 90{\%} of the cases, with cell count always inferior to 50/$\mu$L.This epidemic raises several questions, such as the potential existence of interactions between Zika virus and Polynesian HLA system and/or the consequences of several recombination events of this virus. This situation should call for increased vigilance, especially in countries where Aedes mosquitoes are present.},

abstract = {A cluster of cases of disease that are close both in space and in time is suggestive of an infectious aetiology. We present statistical tests for space-time clusters of disease for the two situations where the population at risk is either known or unknown as a function of space and time. The tests are derived using standard statistical methodology from a simple mathematical model of disease spread, i.e. they are derived as score tests from a likelihood function in which the infection process is modelled as a point process whose intensity becomes greater near an infector. A problem for such tests is that, when investigating whether or not a disease may be of infectious origin, the space and time distances characterising closeness to an infection are very likely to be unknown. The proposed methodology copes with this difficulty in a statistically acceptable way, without requiring multiple tests whose interpretation would be doubtful. When the underlying population size is unknown, the test reduces to a modification of the Knox test. An example of its use is given as epidemiology, risk, space-time cluster, likelihood and Knox test. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Attitudes and approaches are more important than the techniques this book can teach. Readers can learn to identify at least the following attitudes understanding and approaches: an approach to the formulation of statistical and data analytical problems such that for example the students shortcut to inference can be properly understood and the role of vague concepts becomes clear; the role of indications (of pointers to behavior not necessarily on prechosen scales) in contrast to conclusions or decisions about prechosen quantities or alternatives; the importance of displays and the value of graphs in forcing the unexpected upon the reader; the importance of re-expression; the need to seek out the real uncertainty as a nontrivial task; the importance of iterated calculation; how the ideas of robustness and resistance can change both what one does and what one thinks; what regression is all about; what regression coefficient can and cannot do; that the behavior of ones data can often be used to guide its analysis; the importance of looking at and drawing information from residuals; and the idea that data analysis can profit from repeated starts and fresh approaches and that there is not just a single analysis for a substantial problem. The 16 chapters of this book include the following: some practical philosophy for data analysis; a background for simple linear regression; the nature and importance of re-expression; a method of direct assessment; the direct and flexible approach to 2 way tables; a review of resistant/robust techniques in the simpler applications; standardization; regression and regression coefficients; a mathematical approach to understanding regression; guided regression and examining regression residuals. Among the special features of this volume are the following: an introduction to stem and leaf displays; use of running medians for smoothing; the ladder of re-expression for straightening curves; methods of re-expression for analysis; special tables to make re-expression easy in hand calculations; robust and resistant measures of location and scale; and regression with errors of measurement.},

abstract = {In response to the sharp rise in the global burden caused by dengue virus (DENV) over the last few decades, the WHO has set out three specific key objectives in its disease control strategy: (i) to estimate the true burden of dengue by 2015; (ii) a reduction in dengue mortality by at least 50{\%} by 2020 (used as a baseline); and (iii) a reduction in dengue morbidity by at least 25{\%} by 2020. Although various elements will all play crucial parts in achieving this goal, from diagnosis and case management to integrated surveillance and outbreak response, sustainable vector control, vaccine implementation and finally operational and implementation research, it seems clear that new tools (e.g. a safe and effective vaccine and/or effective vector control) are key to success. The first dengue vaccine was licensed in December 2015, Dengvaxia{\textregistered} (CYD-TDV) developed by Sanofi Pasteur. The WHO has provided guidance on the use of CYD-TDV in endemic countries, for which there are a variety of considerations beyond the risk-benefit evaluation done by regulatory authorities, including public health impact and cost-effectiveness. Population-level vaccine impact and economic and financial aspects are two issues that can potentially be considered by means of mathematical modelling, especially for new products for which empirical data are still lacking. In December 2014 a meeting was convened by the WHO in order to revisit the current status of dengue transmission models and their utility for public health decision-making. Here, we report on the main points of discussion and the conclusions of this meeting, as well as next steps for maximising the use of mathematical models for vaccine decision-making.},

The first is a policy with high institutional density launched by the previous Administration, constituting an example of path dependence. The other three are innovations in areas where there had been weaknesses in Federal government action. The four policy priorities are strategies focused on solving key problems in the Brazilian health system. However, they display important differences in their historical development, political and institutional base, inclusion on the Federal agenda, and implications for the principles of the Unified National Health System. Although incremental changes have been introduced, national health policy has been characterized predominantly by continuity.},

abstract = {Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature is written with students and scholars of literature in mind but will be applicable to other humanists and social scientists wishing to extend their methodological tool kit to include quantitative and computational approaches to the study of text. Computation provides access to information in text that we simply cannot gather using traditional qualitative methods of close reading and human synthesis. Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature provides a practical introduction to computational text analysis using the open source programming language R. R is extremely popular throughout the sciences and because of its accessibility, R is now used increasingly in other research areas. Readers begin working with text right away and each chapter works through a new technique or process such that readers gain a broad exposure to core R procedures and a basic understanding of the possibilities of computational text analysis at both the micro and macro scale. Each chapter builds on the previous as readers move from small scale “microanalysis” of single texts to large scale “macroanalysis” of text corpora, and each chapter concludes with a set of practice exercises that reinforce and expand upon the chapter lessons. The book's focus is on making the technical palatable and making the technical useful and immediately gratifying.},

Rural and urban data for traffic mortality, VMT, and population were obtained for each state from the Federal Highway Administration for 1998-2000. Linear regression was used to estimate the effect of population density, VMT per capita, southern location, and presence of a trauma system on mortality. Variation in rural mortality rate (per 100,000 population) was proportional to rural VMT per capita, but population density and southern location were also independent predictors, together accounting for 91{\%} of this variation. Variation in urban mortality rates was not affected by population density, but urban rates were also higher in the south. The exposure-based rural mortality rate (deaths per 100 million VMT) was inversely proportional to population density, which along with southern location explained 41{\%} of the variation from state to state. The presence of a state trauma system did not measurably affect mortality. After controlling for VMT and southern location, state population density was a moderately strong predictor of rural but not urban traffic mortality rates.},

abstract = {We explored the effect of human mobility on the spatio-temporal dynamics of Dengue with a stochastic model that takes into account the epidemiological dynamics of the infected mosquitoes and humans, with different mobility patterns of the human population. We observed that human mobility strongly affects the spread of infection by increasing the final size and by changing the morphology of the epidemic outbreaks. When the spreading of the disease is driven only by mosquito dispersal (flight), a main central focus expands diffusively. On the contrary, when human mobility is taken into account, multiple foci appear throughout the evolution of the outbreaks. These secondary foci generated throughout the outbreaks could be of little importance according to their mass or size compared with the largest main focus. However, the coalescence of these foci with the main one generates an effect, through which the latter develops a size greater than the one obtained in the case driven only by mosquito dispersal. This increase in growth rate due to human mobility and the coalescence of the foci are particularly relevant in temperate cities such as the city of Buenos Aires, since they give more possibilities to the outbreak to grow before the arrival of the low-temperature season. The findings of this work indicate that human mobility could be the main driving force in the dynamics of vector epidemics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identifying human and malaria parasite movements is important for control planning across all transmission intensities. Imported infections can reintroduce infections into areas previously free of infection, maintain 'hotspots' of transmission and import drug resistant strains, challenging national control programmes at a variety of temporal and spatial scales. Recent analyses based on mobile phone usage data have provided valuable insights into population and likely parasite movements within countries, but these data are restricted to sub-national analyses, leaving important cross-border movements neglected.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: National census data were used to analyse and model cross-border migration and movement, using East Africa as an example. 'Hotspots' of origin-specific immigrants from neighbouring countries were identified for Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Populations of origin-specific migrants were compared to distance from origin country borders and population size at destination, and regression models were developed to quantify and compare differences in migration patterns. Migration data were then combined with existing spatially-referenced malaria data to compare the relative propensity for cross-border malaria movement in the region.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The spatial patterns and processes for immigration were different between each origin and destination country pair. Hotspots of immigration, for example, were concentrated close to origin country borders for most immigrants to Tanzania, but for Kenya, a similar pattern was only seen for Tanzanian and Ugandan immigrants. Regression model fits also differed between specific migrant groups, with some migration patterns more dependent on population size at destination and distance travelled than others. With these differences between immigration patterns and processes, and heterogeneous transmission risk in East Africa and the surrounding region, propensities to import malaria infections also likely show substantial variations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This was a first attempt to quantify and model cross-border movements relevant to malaria transmission and control. With national census available worldwide, this approach can be translated to construct a cross-border human and malaria movement evidence base for other malaria endemic countries. The outcomes of this study will feed into wider efforts to quantify and model human and malaria movements in endemic regions to facilitate improved intervention planning, resource allocation and collaborative policy decisions.},

abstract = {Dengue fever is a major public health issue affecting billions of people in over 100 countries across the globe. This challenge is growing as the invasive mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, expand their distributions and increase their population sizes. Hence there is an increasing need to devise effective control methods that can contain dengue outbreaks. Here we construct an epidemiological model for virus transmission between vectors and hosts on a network of host populations distributed among city and town patches, and investigate disease control through vaccination and vector control using variants of the sterile insect technique (SIT). Analysis of the basic reproductive number and simulations indicate that host movement across this small network influences the severity of epidemics. Both vaccination and vector control strategies are investigated as methods of disease containment and our results indicate that these controls can be made more effective with mixed strategy solutions. We predict that reduced lethality through poor SIT methods or imperfectly efficacious vaccines will impact efforts to control disease spread. In particular, weakly efficacious vaccination strategies against multiple virus serotype diversity may be counter productive to disease control efforts. Even so, failings of one method may be mitigated by supplementing it with an alternative control strategy. Generally, our network approach encourages decision making to consider connected populations, to emphasise that successful control methods must effectively suppress dengue epidemics at this landscape scale.},

abstract = {Background: Risk maps identifying suitable locations for infection transmission are important for public health planning. Data on dengue infection rates are not readily available in most places where the disease is known to occur. Methods: A newly available add-in to Esri's ArcGIS software package, the ArcGIS Predictive Analysis Toolset (PA Tools), was used to identify locations within Africa with environmental characteristics likely to be suitable for transmission of dengue virus. Results: A more accurate, robust, and localized (1 km ?? 1 km) dengue risk map for Africa was created based on bioclimatic layers, elevation data, high-resolution population data, and other environmental factors that a search of the peer-reviewed literature showed to be associated with dengue risk. Variables related to temperature, precipitation, elevation, and population density were identified as good predictors of dengue suitability. Areas of high dengue suitability occur primarily within West Africa and parts of Central Africa and East Africa, but even in these regions the suitability is not homogenous. Conclusion: This risk mapping technique for an infection transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes draws on entomological, epidemiological, and geographic data. The method could be applied to other infectious diseases (such as Zika) in order to provide new insights for public health officials and others making decisions about where to increase disease surveillance activities and implement infection prevention and control efforts. The ability to map threats to human and animal health is important for tracking vectorborne and other emerging infectious diseases and modeling the likely impacts of climate change.},

And yet, there is only slow and modest progress in terms of improving the spatial and temporal accuracy of measuring accessibility and equity of accessibility to health care services. This paper critically reviews the latest methodological and empirical research developments and trends in this area through a transport geography lens. More specifically, this paper discusses recent accomplishments in terms of modeling accessibility and provides a systematic and comprehensive literature review of their application in empirical studies of health care delivery. Based on this literature review a research agenda is put forward, identifying knowledge gaps that transport researchers can help to fill. These knowledge gaps pertain to the need for more spatially disaggregated, individualized and temporally-aware accessibility metrics, more sophisticated geocomputational tools to operationalize such metrics and improved measurement of equity considerations in empirical research.},

abstract = {Many KDD systems incorporate an implicit or explicit preference for simpler models, but this use of "Occam's razor" has been strongly criticized by several authors (e.g., Schaffer, 1993; Webb, 1996). This controversy arises partly because Occam's razor has been interpreted in two quite different ways. The first interpretation (simplicity is a goal in itself) is essentially correct, but is at heart a preference for more comprehensible models. The second interpretation (simplicity leads to greater accuracy) is much more problematic. A critical review of the theoretical arguments for and against it shows that it is unfounded as a universal principle, and demonstrably false. A review of empirical evidence shows that it also fails as a practical heuristic. This article argues that its continued use in KDD risks causing significant opportunities to be missed, and should therefore be restricted to the comparatively few applications where it is appropriate. The article proposes and reviews the use of domain constraints as an alternative for avoiding overfilling, and examines possible methods for handling the accuracy-comprehensibility trade-off. {\textcopyright} 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

@article{Polinder2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The consequences of non-fatal road traffic injuries (RTI) are increasingly adopted by policy makers as an indicator of traffic safety. However, it is not agreed upon which level of severity should be used as cut-off point for assessing road safety performance. Internationally, within road safety, injury severity is assessed by means of the maximum abbreviated injury scale (MAIS). The choice for a severity cut-off point highly influences the measured disease burden of RTI. This paper assesses the burden of RTI in terms of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) by hospitalization status and MAIS cut-off point in the Netherlands.

METHODS: Hospital discharge register (HDR) and emergency department (ED) data for RTI in the Netherlands were selected for the years 2007-2009, as well as mortality data. The incidence, years lived with disability (YLD), years of life lost (YLL) owing to premature death, and DALYs were calculated. YLD for admitted patients was subdivided by MAIS severity levels.

RESULTS: RTI resulted in 48,500 YLD and 27,900 YLL respectively, amounting to 76,400 DALYs per year in the Netherlands. The largest proportion of DALYs is related to fatalities (37{\%}), followed by admitted MAIS 2 injuries (25{\%}), ED treated injuries (16{\%}) and admitted MAIS 3+ injuries (18{\%}). Admitted MAIS 1 injuries only account for a small fraction of DALYs (4{\%}). In the Netherlands, the diseases burden of RTI is highest among cyclists with 39{\%} of total DALYs. One half of all bicycle related DALYs are attributable to admitted MAIS 2+ injuries, but ED treated injuries also account for a large proportion of DALYs in this group (28{\%}). Car occupants are responsible for 26{\%} of all DALYs, primarily caused by fatalities (66{\%}), followed by admitted MAIS 2+ injuries (25{\%}). ED treated injuries only account for 5{\%} of DALYs in this group.

CONCLUSIONS: When using admitted MAIS 3+ or admitted MAIS 2+ as severity cut-off point, 54{\%} and 80{\%} of all DALYs are captured respectively. Assessing the influence of different severity cut-off points by MAIS on the proportion and number of DALYs captured gives valuable information for guiding choices on the definition of serious RTI.},

abstract = {The conflict between cultivated land protection and economic development has become increasingly acute in recent years. Despite, intensive researches made on this conflict, little attention has been paid to the spatial correlation of variables. In view of this, the paper introduces the spatial panel regression model to estimate, and test whether the relationship between economic growth and cultivated land conversion conforms to Kuznets curve. Research results show that the area of converted cultivated land in China exhibits strong spatial auto-correlation; the spatial panel model with time effect and fixed effect is more stable and significant than conventional panel mode, and that the relationship between economic growth and cultivated land conversion agrees with the inverted U-shape of Kuznets curve, with inflection point occurring when average per capita GDP reaches ¥31330.93 (calculated at comparable price of 1999). On the basis of analysis, it is suggested that the government, with a view to developing economy alongside protecting cultivated land, should attach more importance to land use and planning in the future, pay more attention to the spatial correlation of cultivated land planning in adjacent areas and make greater efforts to increase the input–output ratio of land.},

abstract = {The scope of this article is to analyze the temporal trends of cervical cancer mortality in Brazil and calculate the projection of mortality through to the year 2030. Deaths that occurred within the 1996-2010 period were analyzed (Mortality Information System). Mortality trend analysis utilized the Joinpoint regression, while Nordpred was utilized for the calculation of projections. For Brazil, decreasing trends were identified (APC = 1.7{\%} CI95{\%}-2.2; -1.1 p {\textless} 0.05). The Midwest region presented a significant reduction trend (APC = -1.3{\%} per year), along with the Southeast (APC = -3.3{\%}) and South (APC = -3.9{\%}) regions. The North and Northeast regions presented stable trends. The states of Acre (APC = -6.5{\%}) and Rio Grande do Sul (APC = -4.1{\%}) presented the most pronounced reduction trends. Analysis of the mortality projections revealed a reduction in mortality rates, starting from the first projected period, with a considerable reduction for the South region. Mortality rates through to the year 2030 are explained, principally, by reductions in the riskof the disease. Cervical cancer mortality presents reducing trends, however these are unequally distributed throughout the country, where the North and Northeast regions present the highest mortality rates.},

This qualitative study was carried out by the Merseyside and Cheshire Zone of the North West Public Health Observatory to assess the needs of local users and producers of public health information.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS:Semi-structured in-depth interviews were carried out with 42 representatives of three major groups in Merseyside and Cheshire: community groups, public-health-related professionals in the local statutory and academic sectors, and information specialists within the National Health Service.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS:Different groups of users and producers encountered different problems in accessing health information. Community groups had significant problems accessing and interpreting health information and were concerned about tokenism and the failure of professionals to recognize lay knowledge. Professionals experienced difficulties in accessing local information from outside their agency and had concerns over partnerships failing to work together to share information. The health information specialists stressed the danger of providing information without supporting intelligence, the difficulty of keeping track of the many local sources, and the importance of having access to local authority data sources. All three groups relied on their own networks in their search for information, and these should not be overlooked in any dissemination strategy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION:Information requires skilled interpretation to become policy-relevant public health intelligence.

abstract = {In 1627, Francis Bacon's New Atlantis described a utopian society in which an embryonic research system contributed to meeting the needs of the society. In this editorial, we use some of the aspirations described in New Atlantis to provide a context within which to consider recent progress in building health research systems to improve health systems and population health. In particular, we reflect on efforts to build research capacity, link research to policy, identify the wider impacts made by the science, and generally build fully functioning research systems to address the needs identified. In 2014, Health Research Policy and Systems has continued to publish one-off papers and article collections covering a range of these issues in both high income countries and low-and middle-income countries. Analysis of these contributions, in the context of some earlier ones, is brought together to identify achievements, challenges and possible ways forward. We show how 2014 is likely to be a pivotal year in the development of ways to assess the impact of health research on policies, practice, health systems, population health, and economic benefits. We demonstrate how the increasing focus on health research systems will contribute to realising the hopes expressed in the World Health Report, 2013, namely that all nations would take a systematic approach to evaluating the outputs and applications resulting from their research investment.},

abstract = {This paper considers ways of thinking about causes and prevention that could guide epidemiology beyond the present era. Discontent with modern epidemiology, in the face of its substantial achievements, is taken as a sign that the guiding principles of the discipline warrant reconsideration. To begin this task, current practices are placed within an historical perspective, in a review of the dominant ideas of successive eras in epidemiology. Then the premises and constraints of the present era of chronic disease epidemiology, with its risk factor paradigm, are specified. Finally, elements of a causal paradigm for an emerging era are proposed. This paradigm encourages thinking about causes at multiple levels of organization and within the historical context of both societies and individuals. The proposed approach aims to preserve and build on the contributions of past eras, as well as the present one.},

abstract = {While many data sets contain multiple relationships, depicting more than one data relationship within a single visualization is challenging. We introduce Bubble Sets as a visualization technique for data that has both a primary data relation with a semantically significant spatial organization and a significant set membership relation in which members of the same set are not necessarily adjacent in the primary layout. In order to maintain the spatial rights of the primary data relation, we avoid layout adjustment techniques that improve set cluster continuity and density. Instead, we use a continuous, possibly concave, isocontour to delineate set membership, without disrupting the primary layout. Optimizations minimize cluster overlap and provide for calculation of the isocontours at interactive speeds. Case studies show how this technique can be used to indicate multiple sets on a variety of common visualizations.},

Fazer levantamento epidemiol{\'{o}}gico dos acidentes motocicl{\'{i}}sticos ocorridos em cidade com mais de um milh{\~{a}}o de habitantes e atendidos em hospital universit{\'{a}}rio de refer{\^{e}}ncia entre julho e novembro de 2010. 

M{\'{E}}TODOS
Estudo transversal com o uso de entrevista estruturada (formul{\'{a}}rio padronizado) para documentar a coleta de dados: idade, sexo, renda mensal, tempo de uso e cilindrada da moto. 

RESULTADOS
A partir de 114 casos, foi observado que o perfil do paciente atendido no hospital em estudo, v{\'{i}}tima de acidente motocicl{\'{i}}stico, {\'{e}} de um indiv{\'{i}}duo jovem, do sexo masculino, possuidor de carteira de habilita{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o h{\'{a}} menos de cinco anos, com renda mensal m{\'{e}}dia em torno de mil reais, possuidor de moto de baixa cilindrada (menos do que 150 cc) e baixa escolaridade. Os acidentes atendidos ocorreram predominantemente no per{\'{i}}metro urbano, no per{\'{i}}odo da tarde, e um ter{\c{c}}o deles foi considerado acidente de trabalho, que gerou {\'{o}}bito em 3{\%} dos casos e fraturas expostas em 11{\%} deles. 

CONCLUS{\~{A}}O
A incid{\^{e}}ncia de acidentes motocicl{\'{i}}sticos envolveu predominantemente homens jovens com pouca experi{\^{e}}ncia no tr{\^{a}}nsito e baixo n{\'{i}}vel de instru{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o. 

OBJECTIVE
Epidemiological survey of motorcycle accidents occurring in a city with over one million inhabitants and treated at university hospital of reference between the months of July and November 2010. 

METHODS
Cross sectional study using structured interview (standardized form) to document the data collection: age, gender, income, using time and capacity of the motorcycle. 

RESULTS
From 114 cases, it was observed that the profile of the victim of motorcycle accident treated at this hospital is a young person, male, possessing a driver's license for less than five years, with a monthly income average around one thousand reais (local currency), owner of a motorcycle with low capacity (less than 150 cc) and low educational attainment. The accidents occurred predominantly in the urban area, in the afternoons and one third of them were considered work-related accidents, death generated in 3 per cent of cases and open fractures in 11 per cent of them. 

CONCLUSION
The incidence of motorcycle accidents involved mainly young men with little experience in traffic and low level of education.},

@article{Hua2010,
abstract = {Recent empirical research has found that there is an inverted U-shaped or Kuznets relationship between income and motor vehicle crash (MVC) deaths, such that MVC deaths increase as national income increases and decrease after reaching a critical level. Corruption has been identified as one of the underlying factors that could affect this relationship, primarily by undermining institutional development and effective enforcement schemes. The total effect of corruption can be decomposed into two components, a direct and an indirect effect. The direct effect measures the immediate impact of corruption on MVC deaths by undermining effective enforcement and regulations, while the indirect effect captures the impact of corruption on hindering increases in per capita income and the consequent impact of reduced income on MVC deaths. By influencing economic growth, corruption can lead to an increase or decrease in MVC deaths depending on the income level. Using data from 60 countries between 1982 and 2003, these effects are estimated using linear panel and fixed effects negative binomial models. The estimation results suggest that corruption has different direct effects for less developed and highly developed countries. It has a negative (decreasing) effect on MVC deaths for less developed countries and a positive (increasing) effect on MVC deaths for highly developed countries. For highly developed countries, the total effect is positive at lower per capita income levels, but decreases with per capita income and becomes negative at per capita income levels of about US{\$} 38,248. For less developed countries, the total effect is negative within the sample range and decreases with increased per capita income. In summary, the results of this study suggest that reduction of corruption is likely a necessary condition to effectively tackle road safety problems.},

In particular, it critically explores new forms of empiricism that declare ‘the end of theory', the creation of data-driven rather than knowledge-driven science, and the development of digital humanities and computational social sciences that propose radically different ways to make sense of culture, history, economy and society. It is argued that: (1) Big Data and new data analytics are disruptive innovations which are reconfiguring in many instances how research is conducted; and (2) there is an urgent need for wider critical reflection within the academy on the epistemological implications of the unfolding data revolution, a task that has barely begun to be tackled despite the rapid changes in research practices presently taking place. After critically reviewing emerging epistemological positions, it is contended that a potentially fruitful approach would be the development of a situated, reflexive and contextually nuanced epistemology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In December 2013, an outbreak of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) caused by the Asian genotype was notified in the Caribbean. The outbreak has since spread to 38 regions in the Americas. By September 2014, the first autochthonous CHIKV infections were confirmed in Oiapoque, North Brazil, and in Feira de Santana, Northeast Brazil.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We compiled epidemiological and clinical data on suspected CHIKV cases in Brazil and polymerase-chain-reaction-based diagnostic was conducted on 68 serum samples from patients with symptom onset between April and September 2014. Two imported and four autochthonous cases were selected for virus propagation, RNA isolation, full-length genome sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. We then followed CDC/PAHO guidelines to estimate the risk of establishment of CHIKV in Brazilian municipalities.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We detected 41 CHIKV importations and 27 autochthonous cases in Brazil. Epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses indicated local transmission of the Asian CHIKV genotype in Oiapoque. Unexpectedly, we also discovered that the ECSA genotype is circulating in Feira de Santana. The presumed index case of the ECSA genotype was an individual who had recently returned from Angola and developed symptoms in Feira de Santana. We estimate that, if CHIKV becomes established in Brazil, transmission could occur in 94{\%} of municipalities in the country and provide maps of the risk of importation of each strain of CHIKV in Brazil.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The etiological strains associated with the early-phase CHIKV outbreaks in Brazil belong to the Asian and ECSA genotypes. Continued surveillance and vector mitigation strategies are needed to reduce the future public health impact of CHIKV in the Americas.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The science of networks has revolutionised research into the dynamics of interacting elements. It could be argued that epidemiology in particular has embraced the potential of network theory more than any other discipline. Here we review the growing body of research concerning the spread of infectious diseases on networks, focusing on the interplay between network theory and epidemiology. The review is split into four main sections, which examine: the types of network relevant to epidemiology; the multitude of ways these networks can be characterised; the statistical methods that can be applied to infer the epidemiological parameters on a realised network; and finally simulation and analytical methods to determine epidemic dynamics on a given network. Given the breadth of areas covered and the ever-expanding number of publications, a comprehensive review of all work is impossible. Instead, we provide a personalised overview into the areas of network epidemiology that have seen the greatest progress in recent years or have the greatest potential to provide novel insights. As such, considerable importance is placed on analytical approaches and statistical methods which are both rapidly expanding fields. Throughout this review we restrict our attention to epidemiological issues.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {This paper presents a systematic review the literature pertaining to the development and use of population-based health indexes with regard to reason for development of the index, geographical level of aggregation, inclusion of health indicators, weighting, sources of data and validation. Any type of population-based health index that incorporated at least two health indicators was considered for inclusion in the review. Studies from the UK, Europe and North America were considered. Seventeen individual studies and one review describing a population-based health index are described. The health indexes were designed for a wide variety of purposes. Levels of geographical aggregation ranged from ward to national level. There was considerable variation between these studies regarding the indicators chosen for inclusion in the health indexes as well as the methods used to combine them. Fourteen of the 18 included studies reported information on weighting of the indicators. None of the studies gave justification for the method of weighting chosen. Indicators were on the whole obtained from routine data sources. Only four of the indexes addressed the problem of validity. A population-based health index is potentially a very useful tool for monitoring the health of a community. More research is needed to determine which health indicators should be used in the formation of such an index and the most appropriate method to combine them. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Background: There have been calls for research to include contextual and macrolevel factors within explanatory models of human health. A network approach focuses on the influence of relationships to predict behavior. Objectives: The first objective was to describe the social network paradigm based in sociology that uses network principles and methods to visualize, quantify, and predict outcomes using the structure and function of relationships. The second objective was to discuss applications of this approach in the context of health to guide future research in pharmacy. Methods: This was a descriptive overview of conceptual models, methods, measures, and analyses that are used in the social network paradigm. Results: The social network paradigm contains conceptual models that rely on relational and structural assumptions to make predictions related to human behavior. Although there is not 1 dominate theory of social networks, several models hold across applications and are commonly used by scholars. The methodology emphasized considerations of network boundaries, sampling strategies, and the type of data collected. Specific variables used in social network analysis were defined and dichotomized into constructs of centrality and cohesion. Network analysis was described in terms of available computational programs, data management, and statistical testing. Related research in health care was applied and ideas for pharmacy were proposed using a social network-based theoretical model. Conclusions: There is growing momentum for health behaviorists to gain familiarity for studying the effect of social networks on behavior. Applications in pharmacy using social network models, methods, and analysis can be used as a stand-alone perspective or in conjunction with other theoretical perspectives in an effort to explain human health or organizational behavior in health care settings. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

@book{Kolaczyk2009,
abstract = {In the past decade, the study of networks has increased dramatically. Researchers from across the sciences—including biology and bioinformatics, computer science, economics, engineering, mathematics, physics, sociology, and statistics—are more and more involved with the collection and statistical analysis of network-indexed data. As a result, statistical methods and models are being developed in this area at a furious pace, with contributions coming from a wide spectrum of disciplines. This book provides an up-to-date treatment of the foundations common to the statistical analysis of network data across the disciplines. The material is organized according to a statistical taxonomy, although the presentation entails a conscious balance of concepts versus mathematics. In addition, the examples—including extended cases studies—are drawn widely from the literature. This book should be of substantial interest both to statisticians and to anyone else working in the area of ‘network science.'},

@article{Abajobir2017,
abstract = {Background The UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are grounded in the global ambition of " leaving no one behind " . Understanding today's gains and gaps for the health-related SDGs is essential for decision makers as they aim to improve the health of populations. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016), we measured 37 of the 50 health-related SDG indicators over the period 1990–2016 for 188 countries, and then on the basis of these past trends, we projected indicators to 2030. Methods We used standardised GBD 2016 methods to measure 37 health-related indicators from 1990 to 2016, an increase of four indicators since GBD 2015. We substantially revised the universal health coverage (UHC) measure, which focuses on coverage of essential health services, to also represent personal health-care access and quality for several non-communicable diseases. We transformed each indicator on a scale of 0–100, with 0 as the 2{\textperiodcentered}5th percentile estimated between 1990 and 2030, and 100 as the 97{\textperiodcentered}5th percentile during that time. An index representing all 37 health-related SDG indicators was constructed by taking the geometric mean of scaled indicators by target. On the basis of past trends, we produced projections of indicator values, using a weighted average of the indicator and country-specific annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2016 with weights for each annual rate of change based on out-of-sample validity. 24 of the currently measured health-related SDG indicators have defined SDG targets, against which we assessed attainment. Findings Globally, the median health-related SDG index was 56{\textperiodcentered}7 (IQR 31{\textperiodcentered}9–66{\textperiodcentered}8) in 2016 and country-level performance markedly varied, with Singapore (86{\textperiodcentered}8, 95{\%} uncertainty interval 84{\textperiodcentered}6–88{\textperiodcentered}9), Iceland (86{\textperiodcentered}0, 84{\textperiodcentered}1–87{\textperiodcentered}6), and Sweden (85{\textperiodcentered}6, 81{\textperiodcentered}8–87{\textperiodcentered}8) having the highest levels in 2016 and Afghanistan (10{\textperiodcentered}9, 9{\textperiodcentered}6–11{\textperiodcentered}9), the Central African Republic (11{\textperiodcentered}0, 8{\textperiodcentered}8–13{\textperiodcentered}8), and Somalia (11{\textperiodcentered}3, 9{\textperiodcentered}5–13{\textperiodcentered}1) recording the lowest. Between 2000 and 2016, notable improvements in the UHC index were achieved by several countries, including Cambodia, Rwanda, Equatorial Guinea, Laos, Turkey, and China; however, a number of countries, such as Lesotho and the Central African Republic, but also high-income countries, such as the USA, showed minimal gains. Based on projections of past trends, the median number of SDG targets attained in 2030 was five (IQR 2–8) of the 24 defined targets currently measured. Globally, projected target attainment considerably varied by SDG indicator, ranging from more than 60{\%} of countries projected to reach targets for under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, and malaria, to less than 5{\%} of countries projected to achieve targets linked to 11 indicator targets, including those for childhood overweight, tuberculosis, and road injury mortality. For several of the health-related SDGs, meeting defined targets hinges upon substantially faster progress than what most countries have achieved in the past. Interpretation GBD 2016 provides an updated and expanded evidence base on where the world currently stands in terms of the health-related SDGs. Our improved measure of UHC offers a basis to monitor the expansion of health services necessary to meet the SDGs. Based on past rates of progress, many places are facing challenges in meeting defined health-related SDG targets, particularly among countries that are the worst off. In view of the early stages of SDG implementation, however, opportunity remains to take actions to accelerate progress, as shown by the catalytic effects of adopting the Millennium Development Goals after 2000. With the SDGs' broader, bolder development agenda, multisectoral commitments and investments are vital to make the health-related SDGs within reach of all populations.},

Abstract The use of big data has increased in recent years in all scientific areas. There are currently three promising areas for the use of big data in healthcare: precision medicine, electronic medical records and the internet of things. Two programming languages have gained momentum in data science: R and Python. Regarding the statistical techniques, it is expected that machine learning (especially classification and regression trees), methodologies for controlling spu-rious associations (such as Bonferroni correction and false discovery rate) and methodologies for dimension reduction (such as principal components analysis and propensity scores) will be increasingly used. Privacy is an issue that will become ever more important in data analysis. The use of big data in healthcare will bring enormous gains in terms of costs, time and lives saved, and needs to be actively defended by data scientists and epidemiologists.},

abstract = {As the analysis of social networks, or networks of interpersonal and social relationships among social groups, has become an increasingly important method of research in several of the social and behavioral sciences, the gathering of network data has outpaced the development of new methods for its analysis. Addressing the need for new analytical tools, Philippa Pattison presents a number of new algebraic models for the analysis of network data, explaining in the process the rationale for an algebraic approach. Models are developed for both complete networks, meaning those representing the social ties between all pairs of members in a given group, and local networks, meaning those structured around the social ties of one particular group member. Many applications are presented and the ways that these methods can address a number of important issues confronting network analysis are explained.},

abstract = {Background The microcephaly epidemic, which started in Brazil in 2015, was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO in 2016. We report the preliminary results of a case-control study investigating the association between microcephaly and Zika virus infection during pregnancy. Methods We did this case-control study in eight public hospitals in Recife, Brazil. Cases were neonates with microcephaly. Two controls (neonates without microcephaly), matched by expected date of delivery and area of residence, were selected for each case. Serum samples of cases and controls and cerebrospinal fluid samples of cases were tested for Zika virus-specific IgM and by quantitative RT-PCR. Laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection during pregnancy was defined as detection of Zika virus-specific IgM or a positive RT-PCR result in neonates. Maternal serum samples were tested by plaque reduction neutralisation assay for Zika virus and dengue virus. We estimated crude odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} CIs using a median unbiased estimator for binary data in an unconditional logistic regression model. We estimated ORs separately for cases with and without radiological evidence of brain abnormalities. Findings Between Jan 15, 2016, and May 2, 2016, we prospectively recruited 32 cases and 62 controls. 24 (80{\%}) of 30 mothers of cases had Zika virus infection compared with 39 (64{\%}) of 61 mothers of controls (p=0{\textperiodcentered}12). 13 (41{\%}) of 32 cases and none of 62 controls had laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection; crude overall OR 55{\textperiodcentered}5 (95{\%} CI 8{\textperiodcentered}6–∞); OR 113{\textperiodcentered}3 (95{\%} CI 14{\textperiodcentered}5–∞) for seven cases with brain abnormalities; and OR 24{\textperiodcentered}7 (95{\%} CI 2{\textperiodcentered}9–∞) for four cases without brain abnormalities. Interpretation Our data suggest that the microcephaly epidemic is a result of congenital Zika virus infection. We await further data from this ongoing study to assess other potential risk factors and to confirm the strength of association in a larger sample size.

Palavras-chave: G{\^{e}}nero e ci{\^{e}}ncia. Mulher na ci{\^{e}}ncia brasileira. Desempenho de homens e mulheres na ci{\^{e}}ncia Abstract Studies on women in science have increased in numbers worldwide, including in Brazil, during the last decades. Considering different approaches, such studies focus on women and their relationship to science, an activity that, whether in past or in present, has always been associated with a male image. Among these approaches, one introduces an analysis on productivity to explain women's lower success in the career. In this present study, three pictures of the women in Brazilian science are presented: the authorship in scientific publications of specific fields, in the whole Brazilian output and the performance of other scientific-academic tasks. Data seek answers to a central research question: do Brazilian women scientists have a lower performance than their male colleagues? Evidence suggests that the relative presence of women in the fields can be a decisive factor to the level of production and that majority of women have equal performance to their male colleagues.

@article{Deshapriya1996,
abstract = {In 1970 and 1978, a set of strict new countermeasures against drunk driving went in to effect in Japan. Analysis of official statistics of motor vehicle fatality data have indicated that alcohol involvement in fatal crashes has declined substantially in Japan since 1970. From the beginning of 1970 to the late 1980s and 1990s, public awareness of and tolerance for the problem of alcohol-impaired driving changed dramatically, as shown in this study. Further it seems that attitudes in Japan on drink driving have improved over the last 20 years or so, instep with a major program of government action. As well as being part of a long running campaign to reduce alcohol related road deaths and injuries, these accident savings are an important part of a national strategy which began in 1970, comprising a well structured legislative program introducing a lower legal limit, progressive penalties for those above the legal limit, over and above Police enforcement strategies underpinning the law and reinforcing the publicity massage. Enactment of the lower legal blood alcohol level with a combination of other severe sanctions is desirable for prevention of alcohol-related traffic casualties, DWI, and accidents, which is shown in this study. Finally, much of the current reduction in alcohol-related fatalities and morbidity reflects that Japanese society has largely endorsed alcohol impaired driving as a socially undesirable behavior. However, this study suggests that it is necessary for policy makers to understand that the DUI problem in Japan must be handled with diverse approaches, rather than relying exclusively on the deterrence based laws.

abstract = {The past year has witnessed contentious debates about public health in England around smoking bans, alcohol licencing, food labelling and junk food advertising. Some people argue that any government intervention in these areas is 'nanny statist'--an unnecessary intrusion into people's lives and what they do, eat and drink. Others argue that only the state can alter the environment that shapes people's decisions and behaviour. This paper suggests that there is a strong argument to be made for government intervention to safeguard public health. Legislation brings about changes that individuals on their own cannot, and sets new standards for the public good. Rather than condemning such activity as 'nanny statist', it might be more appropriate to view it as a form of 'stewardship'. The paper draws on international evidence about alcohol use, smoking and road safety to show how taxation, advertising bans, regulations proscribing behaviour and education create a public health framework and shape individual choices towards healthier and safer behaviour.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. A generalized (extreme Studentized deviate) ESD many-outlier procedure is given for detecting from 1 to k outliers in a data set. This procedure has an advantage over the original ESD many-outlier procedure (Rosner 1975) in that it controls the type I error both under the hypothesis of no outliers and under the alternative hypotheses of 1, 2, ..., k-i outliers. A method is given for approximating percentiles for this procedure based on the t distribution. This method is shown to be adequately accurate using Monte Carlo simulation, for detecting up to 10 outliers in samples as small as 25. Tables are given for implementing this method for n = 25(1)50(10)100(50)500; k = 10, a = .05, .01, .005.},

Using almost 35,000 small Census areas (Local Super Output Areas: LSOAs) as our units of analysis, the locations of hospices, and estimated drive times from LSOAs to hospices we construct an accessibility 'score' for each LSOA, for England and Wales as a whole. Data on cancer mortality are used as a proxy for the 'demand' for hospice care and we then identify that subset of small areas in which accessibility (service supply) is relatively poor yet the potential 'demand' for hospice services is above average. That subset is then filtered according to the deprivation score for each LSOA, in order to identify those LSOAs which are also above average in terms of deprivation. While urban areas are relatively well served, large parts of England and Wales have poor access to hospices, and there is a risk that the needs of those living in relatively deprived areas may be unmet. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Much of this progress is attributable to strengthening laws against impaired driving along with vigorous enforcement efforts aimed at deterring impaired driving. In addition, many useful strategies can also be applied that focus on the control of alcohol availability, use, and promotion. Alcohol policies include controls on the price of alcohol, the location, density, and opening hours of sales outlets, controls on the social availability of alcohol, and on the promotion and advertising of alcohol. Enforcement of these policies is an important aspect of their effectiveness. These strategies have been shown to be effective or promising in reducing impaired driving as well as other consequences related to alcohol use and misuse.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe the past 10 years of KDD and outline predictions for the next 10 years. 1. THE PRE-HISTORY OF KDD I have long been interested in topics of machine learning and discovery. For my Ph.D., I studied how a database system could optimize itself through machine learning. In 1986, while working at GTE Laboratories on CALIDA, an intelligent database assistant for integrating multiple databases, I found a query that could be optimized by a factor of 100 if the optimizer knew a simple pattern like file1 join with file2 will always have field1 = A I have started looking at the ways of automatically discovering such patterns and attended Gio Wiederhold tutorial in 1987 at Int. Conf. on Database Engineering in LA, entitled "Extracting Knowledge from Data". Gio and his student R. Blum [1] have developed Rx, the first program that analyzed historical data from about 50,000 Stanford patients, and looked for unexpected side-effects of drugs. The program did discover some side effects that were unknown to its authors, and the approach looked very promising. However, I could not quite convince GTE management that discovery in data was a good idea. One senior manager told me that he thought that data mining was a solved problem --I could apply a decision tree (and building a decision tree was a solved problem, wasn't it?) to the database and presto --I will have all the results I need.},

abstract = {Objective. To determine what stakeholders perceive as barriers and facilitators to creating a national public health observatory (PHO) in Trinidad and Tobago. Methods. A descriptive study was conducted based on 15 key informant interviews carried out from April to September 2013. The key informants worked within the health care sector in Trinidad and Tobago. Using a semi-structured interview guide, information was collected on knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about creating a PHO; barriers and facilitators to creating and sustaining a PHO; legal considerations; and human resource and information technology requirements. Common themes of the responses were identified. Results. The majority of participants supported the development of a national PHO, recognized its value in informing their work, and indicated that a national PHO could 1) provide information to support evidence-informed decision-making for health policy and strategic planning; 2) facilitate data management by establishing data policies, procedures, and standards; 3) increase the use of data by synthesizing and disseminating information; and 4) provide data for benchmarking. However, a number of barriers were identified, including 1) the perception that data collection is not valued; 2) untimely availability of data; 3) limited data synthesis, dissemination, and utilization to inform decision-making; and 4) challenges related to the allocation of human resources and existing information technology. Conclusions. Key informants support the development of a national PHO in Trinidad and Tobago. The findings align well within the components of the conceptual framework for establishing national health observatories. A stepwise approach to establishing a national PHO in Trinidad and Tobago, beginning with structural components and followed by functional components, is recommended. A national PHO in Trinidad and Tobago could serve as a model for other countries in the Caribbean.},

abstract = {Companies have realized they need to hire data scientists, academic institutions are scrambling to put together data-science programs, and publications are touting data science as a hot—even ‘‘sexy''—career choice. However, there is confusion about what exactly data science is, and this confusion could lead to disillusionment as the concept diffuses into meaningless buzz. In this article, we argue that there are good reasons why it has been hard to pin down exactly what is data science. One reason is that data science is intricately intertwined with other important concepts also of growing importance, such as big data and data-driven decision making. Another reason is the natural tendency to associate what a practitioner does with the definition of the practitioner's field; this can result in overlooking the fundamentals of the field. We believe that trying to define the boundaries of data science precisely is not of the utmost importance. We can debate the boundaries of the field in an academic setting, but in order for data science to serve business effectively, it is important (i) to understand its relationships to other important related concepts, and (ii) to begin to identify the fundamental principles underlying data science. Once we embrace (ii), we can much better understand and explain exactly what data science has to offer. Furthermore, only once we embrace (ii) should we be comfortable calling it data science. In this article, we present a perspective that addresses all these concepts. We close by offering, as examples, a partial list of fundamental principles underlying data science.},

abstract = {The goal of this research is to create a theoretical framework for the identification of cancer risk factor disparities and address the recognition of geographic patterns in these factors. 34 secondary variables covering the entire US at the county level in 2010 were analyzed, both individually and grouped (theoretically and statistically), in relation to the mortality to incidence ratio (MIR) for all cancer sites. An a priori assessment and a principal components analysis (PCA) were used to group variables to test societal constructs. OLS and geographically weighted regressions (GWRs) were used to assess influence of both individual and grouped variables against the MIR. The theoretical grouping of variables showed little change in predictive capability of OLS models. In GWR model, there was marked improvement over the OLS. Maps produced using local R2 showed clear regional patterns of influence between the indicators and the MIR. Both the theoretical model and the justification for a spatial approach to cancer risk factor disparities were shown to be effective in this paper. The link between this suite of indicators and the health outcomes is clear, and supports the idea that a full representation of the SES landscape should be used to both predict health outcomes and to assess policy options for improving these outcomes. With the presence of definitive regional patterns and clear connections between the MIR and societal groupings, the findings from this research suggest a need to shift to a more comprehensive and spatial approach to cancer disparities research.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Over 8 years, we have developed an innovative computer decision support system that improves appropriate delivery of pediatric screening and care. This system employs a guidelines evaluation engine using data from the electronic health record (EHR) and input from patients and caregivers. Because guideline recommendations typically exceed the scope of one visit, the engine uses a static prioritization scheme to select recommendations. Here we extend an earlier idea to create patient-tailored prioritization.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We used Bayesian structure learning to build networks of association among previously collected data from our decision support system. Using area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a measure of discriminability (a sine qua non for expected value calculations needed for prioritization), we performed a structural analysis of variables with high AUC on a test set. Our source data included 177 variables for 29 402 patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The method produced a network model containing 78 screening questions and anticipatory guidance (107 variables total). Average AUC was 0.65, which is sufficient for prioritization depending on factors such as population prevalence. Structure analysis of seven highly predictive variables reveals both face-validity (related nodes are connected) and non-intuitive relationships.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: We demonstrate the ability of a Bayesian structure learning method to 'phenotype the population' seen in our primary care pediatric clinics. The resulting network can be used to produce patient-tailored posterior probabilities that can be used to prioritize content based on the patient's current circumstances.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of EHR-driven population phenotyping for patient-tailored prioritization of pediatric preventive care services.},

abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information tech-nology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biolo-gy, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the devel-opment of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting—the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression {\&} path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for " wide " data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.},

abstract = {Movement of malaria across international borders poses a major obstacle to achieving malaria elimination in the 34 countries that have committed to this goal. In border areas, malaria prevalence is often higher than in other areas due to lower access to health services, treatment-seeking behaviour of marginalized populations that typically inhabit border areas, difficulties in deploying prevention programmes to hard-to-reach communities, often in difficult terrain, and constant movement of people across porous national boundaries. Malaria elimination in border areas will be challenging and key to addressing the challenges is strengthening of surveillance activities for rapid identification of any importation or reintroduction of malaria. This could involve taking advantage of technological advances, such as spatial decision support systems, which can be deployed to assist programme managers to carry out preventive and reactive measures, and mobile phone technology, which can be used to capture the movement of people in the border areas and likely sources of malaria importation. Additionally, joint collaboration in the prevention and control of cross-border malaria by neighbouring countries, and reinforcement of early diagnosis and prompt treatment are ways forward in addressing the problem of cross-border malaria.},

Realizar uma an{\'{a}}lise comparativa entre as les{\~{o}}es encontradas em motociclistas envolvidos em acidentes de tr{\^{a}}nsito e v{\'{i}}timas de outros mecanismos de trauma fechado. 

M{\'{E}}TODOS
An{\'{a}}lise dos protocolos (colhidos prospectivamente) dos traumatizados com idade superior a 13 anos, admitidos de 10/06/2008 a 01/09/2009, v{\'{i}}timas de trauma fechado. Foram coletadas informa{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es sobre mecanismo de trauma, dados vitais {\`{a}} admiss{\~{a}}o, exames complementares, les{\~{o}}es e tratamento. A estratifica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da gravidade do trauma e das les{\~{o}}es foi realizada pelo c{\'{a}}lculo dos {\'{i}}ndices de trauma: RTS, escala de coma de Glasgow (ECG), AIS, ISS e TRISS. Comparamos as vari{\'{a}}veis entre os motociclistas (grupo A) e os demais (grupo B). Consideramos graves as les{\~{o}}es com AIS {\textgreater} 3. Para a an{\'{a}}lise estat{\'{i}}stica, utilizamos os testes t de Student, Mann Whitney, qui-quadrado e Fisher, considerando p{\textless}0,05 significativo. 

RESULTADOS
Foram inclu{\'{i}}dos no estudo 3.783 v{\'{i}}timas de trauma fechado, com idade de 14 a 99 anos, sendo 76,0{\%} do sexo masculino. Os mecanismos de trauma mais frequentes foram os acidentes com motociclistas (24,4{\%}) e atropelamentos (22,6{\%}). Na compara{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o das vari{\'{a}}veis entre os grupos A e B, observamos que os motociclistas apresentaram, significativamente, (p{\textless}0,05), menor m{\'{e}}dia et{\'{a}}ria (28,9±8,5 anos vs. 42,4±18,5 anos) e menor m{\'{e}}dia de AIS em segmento cef{\'{a}}lico (0,3±0,9 vs. 0,8±1,1), como tamb{\'{e}}m, maior m{\'{e}}dia da ECG {\`{a}} admiss{\~{a}}o (14,5±1,9 vs. 14,2±2,2), de AIS em extremidades (1,5±1,2 vs. 0,9±1,2), de RTS (7,8±0,5 vs. 7,7±0,6) e de TRISS (0,98±0,1 vs. 0,97±0,1). O g{\^{e}}nero masculino foi significativamente mais frequente no grupo A (87,9{\%} vs. 72,6{\%}). Na compara{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o das les{\~{o}}es entre os grupos, notamos que os motociclistas apresentaram, significativamente, (p{\textless}0,05), menor frequ{\^{e}}ncia de hematomas extradurais (0,6{\%} vs. 2,1{\%}), hematomas subdurais (0,9{\%} vs. 2,1{\%}), hemorragia subaracn{\'{o}}idea (0,9{\%} vs. 2,2{\%}), contus{\~{a}}o encef{\'{a}}lica (1,2{\%} vs. 3,6{\%}) e les{\~{o}}es graves em cr{\^{a}}nio (4,8{\%} vs. 9,4{\%}), bem como maior frequ{\^{e}}ncia de les{\~{a}}o axonal difusa (1,6{\%} vs. 0,7{\%}), fraturas de membros superiores (7,9{\%} vs. 4,4{\%}), inferiores (7,7{\%} vs. 5,2{\%}), e les{\~{o}}es graves em extremidades (20,6{\%} vs. 12,6{\%}). 

CONCLUS{\~{A}}O
Em compara{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o {\`{a}}s v{\'{i}}timas dos demais mecanismos de trauma, os motociclistas apresentaram menor frequ{\^{e}}ncia e gravidade das les{\~{o}}es em segmento cef{\'{a}}lico, bem como maior frequ{\^{e}}ncia e gravidade das les{\~{o}}es em extremidades. 

OBJECTIVE
To conduct a comparative analysis of the lesions found among motorcycle riders involved in traffic accidents and victims of other mechanisms of blunt trauma. 

METHODS
Analysis of data prospectively collected on protocols for trauma patients older than 13 years, admitted from 06/10/2008 to 09/01/2009, victims of blunt trauma. Data collected included trauma mechanism, vital signs at admission, laboratory tests, injuries, and treatment. Stratification of trauma and lesion severity was performed by calculating the trauma index: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Revised Trauma Score (RTS), Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), Injury Severity Score (ISS) and TRISS. We compared the variables between motorcycle riders (group A) and the others (group B). Severe injuries were considered when AIS {\textgreater} 3. For statistical analysis, we used Student's t, Mann Whitney, chi-square and Fisher's test, with p{\textless}0.05 considered statistically significant. 

RESULTS
The study included 3,783 blunt trauma victims, aged 14 to 99 years, of which 76.0{\%} were males. The most frequent trauma mechanisms were accidents involving motorcycle riders (24.4{\%}) and pedestrians (22.6{\%}). When comparing the variables between groups A and B, we observed that motorcycle riders were significantly (p{\textless}0.05) younger (28.9±8.5 years vs. 42.4±18.5 years) and had lower mean AIS in the head segment (0.3±0.9 vs. 0.8±1.1), as well as higher mean GCS at admission (14.5±1.9 vs. 14.2±2.2), AIS in the extremities (1.5±1.2 vs. 0.9±1.2), RTS (7.8±0.5 vs. 7.7±0.6) and TRISS (0.98±0.1 vs. 0.97±0.1). Men were significantly more frequent in group A (87.9{\%} vs. 72.6{\%}). When comparing injuries between groups, we observed that the motorcycle riders had significantly (p{\textless}0.05) lower frequency of extradural hematomas (0.6{\%} vs. 2.1{\%}), subdural hematomas (0.9{\%} vs. 2.1{\%}), subarachnoid hemorrhage (0.9{\%} vs. 2.2{\%}), brain injury (1.2 vs. 3.6{\%}), and severe head injuries (4.8{\%} vs. 9.4{\%}), as well as higher frequency of diffuse axonal injury (1.6{\%} vs. 0.7{\%}), upper- (7.9{\%} vs. 4.4{\%}) and lower-limb fractures (7.7{\%} vs. 5, 2{\%}), and severe extremity lesions (20.6{\%} vs. 12.6{\%}). 

CONCLUSION
Compared to victims of other trauma mechanisms, motorcycle riders had a lower frequency and severity of head injuries, as well as increased frequency and severity of lesions in the extremities.},

abstract = {This study seeks to examine the extent to which cancer services are geographically located according to cancer incidence, and assess the association with cancer survival. We identified hospital sites serving English PCTs (Primary Care Trusts) with the management and treatment of breast, lung and colorectal cancer. Geographical access was estimated as travel time in minutes from LSOAs (Lower Super Output Areas) to the nearest hospital site and aggregated to PCT level. Correlations between PCT level mean travel times and cancer cases were estimated using Spearman's rank correlation. Associations between PCT level mean travel times and cancer relative survival rates were estimated using linear regression with adjustment for area deprivation and for a PCT level measure of the reported ease of obtaining a doctor's appointment. We found that cancer services tended to be located farther from areas with more cancer cases, and longer average travel times are associated with worse survival after adjustment for age, sex, year and area deprivation. This suggests that geographical access to cancer services remains a concern in England.},

In March 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC) expanded its vector surveillance maps for A. aegypti and A. albopictus, the mosquito vectors for these arboviruses. They have now been shown to inhabit a larger portion of the U.S., including the heavily populated northeast corridor. Emergency physicians need to further familiarize themselves with these diseases, which have classically been considered only in returning travelers but may soon be encountered in the U.S. even in the absence of travel. In this paper, we discuss the presentation and treatment of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya, as well as special challenges presented to the emergency physician in evaluating a patient with a suspected arbovirus infection.},

Everyone could observe that this kind of infectious disease often has the ability to cross countries borders and spread rapidly. Preventing, monitoring and controlling the outbreak of these diseases have appeared to be a public health problem of primary importance for years. However, although numerous works have been conducted in order to understand and study epidemics, this subject remains a topical issue because of the complexity of the phenomena. In this paper, we present new opportunities offered by the field of social networks for understanding the spread of infectious diseases. This work focuses both on techniques already used in epidemiology, and very recent works in social network analysis that open new perspectives. We give an overview of methods currently used to model and study the spread of diseases and future directions that the social network approach allows to glimpse.},

abstract = {The interest is on monitoring incoming space–time events to detect an emergent space–time cluster as early as possible. Assume that point process events are continuously recorded in space and time. In a certain unknown moment, a small localized cluster of increased intensity starts to emerge. Its location is also unknown. The aim is to let an alarm to go off as soon as possible after its emergence, but avoiding that it goes off unnecessarily. The alarm system should also provide an estimate of the cluster location. In addition to that, the alarm system should take into account the purely spatial and the purely temporal heterogeneity, which are not specified by the user. A space–time surveillance system with these characteristics using a martingale approach to derive the surveillance system properties is proposed. The average run length for the situation when there are clusters present in the data is appropriately defined and the method is illustrated in practice. The algorithm is implemented in a freely available stand-alone software and it is also a feature in a freely available GIS system.},

@article{Cohen2008,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Text mining is the use of automated methods for exploiting the enormous amount of knowledge available in the biomedical literature. There are at least as many motivations for doing text mining work as there are types of bioscientists. Model organism database curators have been heavy participants in the development of the field due to their need to process large numbers of publications in order to populate the many data fields for every gene in their species of interest. Bench scientists have built biomedical text mining applications to aid in the development of tools for interpreting the output of high-throughput assays and to improve searches of sequence databases (see 1 for a review). Bioscientists of every stripe have built applications to deal with the dual issues of the double-exponential growth in the scientific literature over the past few years and of the unique issues in searching PubMed/MEDLINE for genomics-related publications. A surprising phenomenon can be noted in the recent history of biomedical text mining: although several systems have been built and deployed in the past few yearsChilibot, Textpresso, and PreBIND (see Text S1 for these and most other citations), for examplethe ones that are seeing high usage rates and are making productive contributions to the working lives of bioscientists have been built not by text mining specialists, but by bioscientists. We speculate on why this might be so below. Three basic types of approaches to text mining have been prevalent in the biomedical domain. Co-occurrencebased methods do no more than look for concepts that occur in the same unit of texttypically a sentence, but sometimes as large as an abstractand posit a relationship between them. (See 2 for an early co-occurrencebased system.) For example, if such a system saw that BRCA1 and breast cancer occurred in the same sentence, it might assume a relationship between breast cancer and the BRCA1 gene. Some early biomedical text mining systems were co-occurrencebased, but such systems are highly error prone, and are not commonly built today. In fact, many text mining practitioners would not consider them to be text mining systems at all. Co-occurrence of concepts in a text is sometimes used as a simple baseline when evaluating more sophisticated systems; as such, they are nontrivial, since even a co-occurrencebased system must deal with variability in the ways that concepts are expressed in human-produced texts. For example, BRCA1 could be referred to by any of its alternate symbolsIRIS, PSCP, BRCAI, BRCC1, or RNF53 (or by any of their many spelling variants, which include BRCA1, BRCA-1, and BRCA 1)or by any of the variants of its full name, viz. breast cancer 1, early onset (its official name per Entrez Gene and the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee), as breast cancer susceptibility gene 1, or as the latter's variant breast cancer susceptibility gene-1. Similarly, breast cancer could be referred to as breast cancer, carcinoma of the breast, or mammary neoplasm. These variability issues challenge more sophisticated systems, as well; we discuss ways of coping with them in Text S1.},

abstract = {Objective: To identify and describe the therapeutic itinerary of elderly patients with cancer treated in outpatient services and hosted in support homes, in the city of Curitiba, state of Paran{\'{a}}. Methods: It was performed a qualitative research with an approach based on the method of Oral History Theme (HOT). Five interviews were held with elders who were in treatment for cancer. The analysis of the stories was made by means of the specific technique of HOT. Results: It was found five main tones and a central theme. Conclusion: The stories analysis showed the path the elders must follow in the subsystems of health care. Therapeutic itinerary of the elderly with cancer was surrounded by doubts, pain, hopes and sadness. Hope in the family and God were the guarantees to overcome the disease. The nurse must know the therapeutic itinerary followed by the elderly to plan the appropriate care, within the social-cultural reality in which subsystems act in health care.},

abstract = {Spatial epidemiology is the description and analysis of geographic variations in disease with respect to demographic, environmental, behavioral, socioeconomic, genetic, and infectious risk factors. We focus on small-area analyses, encompassing disease mapping, geographic correlation studies, disease clusters, and clustering. Advances in geographic information systems, statistical methodology, and availability of high-resolution, geographically referenced health and environmental quality data have created unprecedented new opportunities to investigate environmental and other factors in explaining local geographic variations in disease. They also present new challenges. Problems include the large random component that may predominate disease rates across small areas. Though this can be dealt with appropriately using Bayesian statistics to provide smooth estimates of disease risks, sensitivity to detect areas at high risk is limited when expected numbers of cases are small. Potential biases and confounding, particularly due to socioeconomic factors, and a detailed understanding of data quality are important. Data errors can result in large apparent disease excess in a locality. Disease cluster reports often arise nonsystematically because of media, physician, or public concern. One ready means of investigating such concerns is the replication of analyses in different areas based on routine data, as is done in the United Kingdom through the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (and increasingly in other European countries, e.g., through the European Health and Environment Information System collaboration). In the future, developments in exposure modeling and mapping, enhanced study designs, and new methods of surveillance of large health databases promise to improve our ability to understand the complex relationships of environment to health.},

The mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently aroused global attention due to its rapid spread since its first detection in May 2015 in Brazil to 22 other countries and other territories in the Americas. The ZIKV outbreak in Brazil, has also been associated with a significant rise in the number of babies born with microcephaly and neurological disorders, and has been declared a 'Global Emergency by the World Health Organization. This explosive spread of ZIKV in Brazil poses challenges for public health preparedness and surveillance for the Olympics and Paralympics which are due to be held in Rio De Janeiro in August, 2016. We review the epidemiology and clinical features of the current ZIKV outbreak in Brazil, highlight knowledge gaps, and review the public health implications of the current ZIKV outbreak in the Americas. We highlight the urgent need for a coordinated collaborative response for prevention and spread of infectious diseases with epidemic potential at mass gatherings events.},

abstract = {There is a considerable literature on the relationship between sprawl and accidents. However, these studies do not account for the spatially correlated effects of sprawl on accidents. In our analysis of 122 jurisdictions in Southeast Michigan, we use a Bayesian spatial autoregressive model to estimate how injuries and fatalities in one jurisdiction are associated with sprawl in that jurisdiction and sprawl in neighboring jurisdictions; we also correct for heteroskedasticity in the data. Using principal component analysis, we create a sprawl index from five underlying land use characteristics. Our results show that the number of injuries and fatalities in a jurisdiction increases with the magnitude of sprawl in neighboring jurisdictions. We believe that this is because more drivers per capita in sprawled jurisdictions traverse similarly sprawled neighboring jurisdictions for daily activities. Furthermore, driving habits attuned to less defensive driving in sprawled jurisdiction are transferred to similarly designed neighboring jurisdictions, contributing to accidents in the latter. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Commonly, data is not easily or often shared between interventions and summary data collected as part of an impact evaluation is often not available until after the intervention is complete. Equally limiting, the workflows that lead to research results are rarely published in a reproducible, reusable, and easy-to-understand fashion for others. Information and communication technologies widely used in commercial and government programs are growing in relevance for international global development professionals and offer a potential towards better data and workflow sharing. However, the technical and custom nature of many data management systems limits their accessibility to non-ICT professionals. The authors propose an end-to-end data collection, management, and dissemination platform designed for use by global development program managers and researchers. The system leverages smartphones, cellular based sensors, and cloud storage and computing to lower the entry barrier to impact evaluation.},

However, the burden is not evenly distributed, and, according to the best available data, there are large variations in the incidence, mortality, and survival between different countries and regions and within specific regions. Many complex factors underlie these variations, including population structure (eg, age, race, and ethnicity), lifestyle, environment, socioeconomic status, risk factor prevalence, mammography use, disease stage at diagnosis, and access to high-quality care. We review recent breast cancer incidence and mortality statistics and explore why these vary so greatly across the world. Further research is needed to fully understand the reasons for variations in breast cancer outcomes. This will aid the development of tailored strategies to improve outcomes in general as well as the standard of care for underserved populations and reduce the burden of breast cancer worldwide.},

We compare the well known spatial correlation Moran's index to three indexes obtained after adjusting for population density, one proposed by Oden, another proposed by Waldh{\"{o}}r, and a third proposed by us in this paper. We find an effect of spatially correlated populations in the type I error probability on the test based on Moran's and Waldh{\"{o}}r's indexes. We conclude also that the test proposed by Oden is powerful to test risk heterogeneity, but it has disadvantages when the interest is solely on the spatial correlation of morbidity risks. In this latter case, we recommend using our proposed test which is more powerful than the usual Moran's index applied directly to the rates.},

abstract = {Efforts have been increasingly invested to improve local health systems' capacities in developing countries. We describe the application of innovative methods based on a social network analysis approach. The findings presented refer to a study carried out between July 2008 and January 2010 in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana. Social network analysis methods were applied in five different districts using the software package Ucinet to calculate the various properties of the social network of eye care providers. The study focused on the managerial decisions made by Ghanaian district hospital managers about the governance of the health system. The study showed that the health system in the Brong Ahafo region experienced significant changes specifically after a key shock, the departure of an international organization. Several other actors at different levels of the network disappeared, the positions of nurses and hospital managers changed, creating new relationships and power balances that resulted in a change in the general structure of the network. The system shifted from a centralized and dense hierarchical network towards an enclaved network composed of five sub-networks. The new structure was less able to respond to shocks, circulate information and knowledge across scales and implement multi-scale solutions than that which it replaced. Although the network became less resilient, it responded better to the management needs of the hospital managers who now had better access to information, even if this information was partial. The change of the network over time also showed the influence of the international organization on generating links and creating connections between actors from different levels. The findings of the study reveal the importance of creating international health connections between actors working in different spatial scales of the health system.},

On the empirical side much has happened in the developments of electronic communication that needs to be considered. From a theoretical point of view the domain-analytic view has proposed that differences between different disciplines and domains should be emphasised. The original model only considered scientific and technical communication as a whole. There is a need both to compare with the humanities and social sciences and to regard internal differences in the sciences. There are also other reasons to reconsider and modify this model today. Offers not only a descriptive model, but also a theoretical perspective from which information systems may be understood and evaluated.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: More than 40{\%} of urban traffic fatalities are alcohol related and the rate of such fatalities varies more than 10-fold across U.S. cities. These variations might be explained by differences in local alcohol control policies and practices. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of state Alcohol Beverage Control agencies and local city police departments in 107 cities that participate in the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System. We examined the association of alcohol control practices in 1997 and alcohol-related traffic fatalities per daily vehicle miles traveled, 1995-1997. RESULTS: Ninety-seven (91{\%}) cities participated. Regulations related to alcohol accessibility, licensure of alcohol outlets, disciplinary procedures of alcohol outlets, and enforcement of blood alcohol concentration laws were associated with lower rates of fatalities. Cities with 9 or fewer of the 20 regulations had 1.46-fold greater alcohol-related traffic fatality rates than cities with 15 or more of these regulations, representing 392 excess deaths annually. Beer consumption was found to be a potential mediator of the effect of regulations on traffic fatalities. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol beverage regulations are associated with alcohol-related traffic fatalities. Localities should consider greater restrictions on alcohol accessibility, stricter disciplinary measures for violations, and stricter licensure requirements as a potential means to reduce alcohol-related traffic fatalities.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of population density on mortality after traffic crashes. Subjects were the drivers of vehicles requiring towing after collisions, sampled by NASS-GES during 1994–1998. Cases were classified by population of crash location (greater or lesser than 25,000) and by population density of the driver's county of residence (using ZIP code and Census data). Cases were also categorized by age, belt use and vehicle speed. Analytic methods for weighted, stratified survey data were used to estimate effects on mortality. A total of 190,721 cases with a specified crash location were identified in the sample, of which 93.7{\%} had a specified population at the crash location, and 94.1{\%} could be linked to the driver's county data. Mortality was higher in locations with populations less than 25,000 and was inversely proportional to the driver's county population density. Age, belt use, and vehicle speed also affected mortality significantly, but the effect of rural location remained after controlling for these factors (O.R. 2.10, 95{\%} C.I. 1.62–2.73). The excess risk for residents of rural areas to die in traffic crashes can be attributed in part to post-crash factors.},

abstract = {Many industries are riding the wave of big data as the new era of data-driven decision making is unveiling. The field of big data analytics is gaining fast traction in industry, academia and the government; the healthcare arena is no different. In this paper, big data analytics are applied to healthcare data that is collected from multiple sources to gain quality insights and apprehend best practices of the field (using new healthcare specific big data tools). The US states are unceasingly pursuing potential improvements to their healthcare's Quality of Service (QoS). Recent changes in data sharing provisions, such as the disposition of the recent Affordable Health Care Act (ACA), changed the rules of the game, and provided the US states with a new set of measurable health quality variables that they couldn't overlook anymore. Individuals in those states without health insurance tend to ignore visiting the clinic even if they feel symptoms of a disease; healthy young individuals with insurance can also have the same behavior. Health experts constantly recommend closer immersion in one's health and more engagement with preventive healthcare. In three experimental studies, this multidisciplinary paper examines historical health data from all over the country, assesses the medical QoS for multiple US states using a new healthcare-specific analytical infrastructure, delivers forecasts and correlations for future healthcare activities, and provides data-driven.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The breast imaging modalities of mammography, ultrasound, and MRI are widely used for screening, diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance of breast cancer. Geographic access to breast imaging services in various modalities is not known at a national level overall or for population subgroups.
METHODS: A retrospective study of 2004-2008 Medicare claims data was conducted to identify ZIP codes in which breast imaging occurred, and data were mapped. Estimated travel times were made for each modality for 215,798 census block groups in the contiguous United States. Using Census 2010 data, travel times were characterized by sociodemographic factors for 92,788,909 women aged ???30 years, overall, and by subgroups of age, race/ethnicity, rurality, education, and median income.
RESULTS: Overall, 85{\%} of women had travel times of ???20 minutes to nearest mammography or ultrasound services, and 70{\%} had travel times of ???20 minutes for MRI with little variation by age. Native American women had median travel times 2-3 times longer for all 3 modalities, compared to women of other racial/ethnic groups. For rural women, median travel times to breast imaging services were 4-8-fold longer than they were for urban women. Black and Asian women had the shortest median travel times to services for all 3??modalities.
CONCLUSIONS: Travel times to mammography and ultrasound breast imaging facilities are short for most women, but for breast MRI, travel times are notably longer. Native American and rural women are disadvantaged in geographic access based on travel times to breast imaging services. This work informs potential interventions to reduce inequities in access and utilization.},

abstract = {This study evaluated independent and joint effects of census tract (CT) poverty and geographic access to mammography on stage at diagnosis for breast cancer. The study included 161,619 women 40+ years old diagnosed with breast cancer between 2004 -2006 in ten participating US states. Multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of late-stage breast cancer diagnosis for the entire study population and by state. Poverty was independently associated with late-stage in the overall population (poverty rates {\textgreater}20{\%} OR=1.30, 95{\%} CI=1.26- 1.35) and for 9 of the 10 states. Geographic access was not associated with late-stage diagnosis after adjusting for CT poverty. State-specific analysis provided little evidence that geographic access was associated with breast cancer stage at diagnosis, and after adjusting for poverty, geographic access mattered in only 1 state. Overall, compared to women with private insurance, the adjusted odds ratios for late stage at diagnosis among women with either no insurance, Medicaid, or Medicare were 1.80 (95{\%} CI = 1.65, 1.96), 1.75 (95{\%} CI = 1.68, 1.84), and 1.05 (95{\%} CI 1.01, 1.08), respectively. Although geographic access to mammography was not a significant predictor of late-stage breast cancer diagnosis, women in high poverty areas or uninsured are at greatest risk of being diagnosed with late-stage breast cancer regardless of geographic location and may benefit from targeted interventions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

National emissions per capita of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are shown to be heavily influenced by the emissions per capita of neighbouring countries. There is also evidence that national emissions per capita of nitrogen oxides are decreased by proximity to high per capita income countries which is inconsistent with nations achieving higher environmental quality at the expense of their neighbours.},

Risk estimates were computed and compared with those previously obtained from the 1996 FARS and roadside survey data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Although the adult relative risk of being involved in a fatal alcohol-related crash apparently did not change from 1996 to 2007, the risk for involvement in an alcohol-related crash for underage women has increased to the point where it has become the same as that for underage men. Further, the risk that sober underage men will become involved in a fatal crash has doubled over the 1996-2007 period.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Compared with estimates obtained from a decade earlier, young women in this study are at an increased risk of involvement in alcohol-related crashes. Similarly, underage sober drivers in this study are more at risk of involvement in a crash than they were a decade earlier.},

As the volumes of data available to lawmakers, civil servants, business people and scientists increase, their effective use becomes more challenging. Keeping up to date with the flood of data, using standard tools for data management and analysis, is fraught with difficulty. The field of visual analytics seeks to provide people with better and more effective ways to understand and analyse these large datasets, while also enabling them to act upon their findings immediately, in real-time. Visual analytics integrates the analytic capabilities of the computer and the abilities of the human analyst, thus allowing novel discoveries and empowering individuals to take control of the analytical process.

abstract = {Objective: To describe and illustrate a four stage methodological approach to capture user knowledge in a biomedical domain area, use that knowledge to design an ontology, and then implement and evaluate the ontology as a health information system (HIS). Methods and materials: A hybrid participatory design-grounded theory (GT-PD) method was used to obtain data and code them for ontology development. Prototyping was used to implement the ontology as a computer-based tool. Usability testing evaluated the computer-based tool. Results: An empirically derived domain ontology and set of three problem-solving approaches were developed as a formalized model of the concepts and categories from the GT coding. The ontology and problem-solving approaches were used to design and implement a HIS that tested favorably in usability testing. Conclusions: The four stage approach illustrated in this paper is useful for designing and implementing an ontology as the basis for a HIS. The approach extends existing ontology development methodologies by providing an empirical basis for theory incorporated into ontology design. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Abstract The last 6 years have seen sustained investment in health data science in the United Kingdom and beyond, which should result in a data science community that is inclusive of all stakeholders, working together to use data to benefit society through the improvement of public health and well-being. However, opportunities made possible through the innovative use of data are still not being fully realised, resulting in research inefficiencies and avoidable health harms. In this paper, we identify the most important barriers to achieving higher productivity in health data science. We then draw on previous research, domain expertise, and theory to outline how to go about overcoming these barriers, applying our core values of inclusivity and transparency. We believe a step change can be achieved through meaningful stakeholder involvement at every stage of research planning, design, and execution and team-based data science, as well as harnessing novel and secure data technologies. Applying these values to health data science will safeguard a social licence for health data research and ensure transparent and secure data usage for public benefit.},

abstract = {In philosophy, Ontology is the basic description of things in the world. In information science, an ontol ogy refers to an engineering artifact, constituted by a specific vocabulary used to describe a certain reality. Ontologies have been proposed for validating both conceptual models and conceptual schemas; however, these roles are quite dissimilar. In this article, we show that ontologies can be better understood if we classify the different uses of the term as it appears in the literature. First, we explain Ontology (upper case O) as used in Philosophy. Then, we propose a differentiation between ontologies of information systems and ontologies for information systems. All three concepts have an important role in information science. We clarify the different meanings and uses of Ontology and ontologies through a comparison of research by Wand and Weber and by Guarino in ontology-driven information systems. The contributions of this article are twofold: (a) It provides a better understanding of what ontologies are, and (b) it explains the double role of ontologies in information science research.},

abstract = {Nearly half the world's population now lives in urban settlements. Cities offer the lure of better employment, education, health care, and culture; and they contribute disproportionately to national economies. However, rapid and often unplanned urban growth is often associated with poverty, environmental degradation and population demands that outstrip service capacity. These conditions place human health at risk. Reliable urban health statistics are largely unavailable throughout the world. Disaggregated intra-urban health data, i.e., for different areas within a city, are even more rare. Data that are available indicate a range of urban health hazards and associated health risks: substandard housing, crowding, air pollution, insufficient or contaminated drinking water, inadequate sanitation and solid waste disposal services, vector-borne diseases, industrial waste, increased motor vehicle traffic, stress associated with poverty and unemployment, among others. Local and national governments and multilateral organizations are all grappling with the challenges of urbanization. Urban health risks and concerns involve many different sectors, including health, environment, housing, energy, transportation, urban planning, and others. Two main policy implications are highlighted: the need for systematic and useful urban health statistics on a disaggregated, i.e., intra-urban, basis, and the need for more effective partnering across sectors. The humanitarian and economic imperative to create livable and sustainable cities must drive us to seek and successfully overcome challenges and capitalize on opportunities. Good urban planning and governance, exchange of best practice models and the determination and leadership of stakeholders across disciplines, sectors, communities and countries will be critical elements of success.},

abstract = {Background Between October, 2013, and April, 2014, French Polynesia experienced the largest Zika virus outbreak ever described at that time. During the same period, an increase in Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome was reported, suggesting a possible association between Zika virus and Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome. We aimed to assess the role of Zika virus and dengue virus infection in developing Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome. Methods In this case-control study, cases were patients with Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome diagnosed at the Centre Hospitalier de Polyn{\'{e}}sie Fran{\c{c}}aise (Papeete, Tahiti, French Polynesia) during the outbreak period. Controls were age-matched, sex-matched, and residence-matched patients who presented at the hospital with a non-febrile illness (control group 1; n=98) and age-matched patients with acute Zika virus disease and no neurological symptoms (control group 2; n=70). Virological investigations included RT-PCR for Zika virus, and both microsphere immunofl uorescent and seroneutralisation assays for Zika virus and dengue virus. Anti-glycolipid reactivity was studied in patients with Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome using both ELISA and combinatorial microarrays. Findings 42 patients were diagnosed with Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome during the study period. 41 (98{\%}) patients with Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome had anti-Zika virus IgM or IgG, and all (100{\%}) had neutralising antibodies against Zika virus compared with 54 (56{\%}) of 98 in control group 1 (p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). 39 (93{\%}) patients with Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome had Zika virus IgM and 37 (88{\%}) had experienced a transient illness in a median of 6 days (IQR 4–10) before the onset of neurological symptoms, suggesting recent Zika virus infection. Patients with Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome had electrophysiological fi ndings compatible with acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) type, and had rapid evolution of disease (median duration of the installation and plateau phases was 6 [IQR 4–9] and 4 days [3–10], respectively). 12 (29{\%}) patients required respiratory assistance. No patients died. Anti-glycolipid antibody activity was found in 13 (31{\%}) patients, and notably against GA1 in eight (19{\%}) patients, by ELISA and 19 (46{\%}) of 41 by glycoarray at admission. The typical AMAN-associated anti-ganglioside antibodies were rarely present. Past dengue virus history did not diff er signifi cantly between patients with Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome and those in the two control groups (95{\%}, 89{\%}, and 83{\%}, respectively). Interpretation This is the fi rst study providing evidence for Zika virus infection causing Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome. Because Zika virus is spreading rapidly across the Americas, at risk countries need to prepare for adequate intensive care beds capacity to manage patients with Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome.

@article{PascaleAllotey2010,
abstract = {Centuries of scientific advances and developments in bio-medical sciences have brought us a long way to understanding and managing disease processes, by reducing them to simplified cause-effect models. For most of the infectious diseases known today, we have the methods and technology to identify the causative agent, understand the mechanism by which pathology is induced and develop the treatment (drugs, vaccines, medical or surgical procedures) to cure, manage or control. Disease, however, occurs within a context of lives fraught with complexity. For any given infectious disease, who gets it, when, why, the duration, the severity, the outcome, the sequel, are bound by a complex interplay of factors related as much to the individual as it is to the physical, social, cultural, political and economic environments. Furthermore each of these factors is in a dynamic state of change, evolving over time as they interact with each other. Simple solutions to infectious diseases are therefore rarely sustainable solutions. Sustainability would require the development of interdisciplinary sciences that allow us to acknowledge, understand and address these complexities as they occur, rather than rely solely on a form of science based on reducing the management of disease to simple paradigms. In this review we examine the current global health responses to the ‘neglected' tropical diseases, which have been prioritized on the basis of an acknowledgment of the complexity of the poverty-disease cycle. However research and interventions for neglected tropical diseases, largely neglect the social and ecological contextual, factors that make these diseases persist in the target populations, continuing instead to focus on the simple bio-medical interventions. We highlight the gaps in the approaches and explore the potential of enhanced interdisciplinary work in the development of long term solutions to disease control.},

abstract = {The burden of malaria has decreased dramatically within the past several years in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, following the scale-up of interventions supported by the Roll Back Malaria Partnership, the President's Malaria Initiative and other partners. It is important to appreciate that the reductions in malaria have not been uniform between and within countries, with some areas experiencing resurgence instead. Furthermore, while interventions have greatly reduced the burden of malaria in many countries, it is also recognized that the malaria decline pre-dated widespread intervention efforts, at least in some cases where data are available. This raises more questions as what other factors may have been contributing to the reduction in malaria transmission and to what extent. The International Center of Excellence for Malaria Research (ICEMR) in Southern Africa aims to better understand the underlying malaria epidemiology, vector ecology and parasite genomics using three contrasting settings of malaria transmission in Zambia and Zimbabwe: an area of successful malaria control, an area of resurgent malaria and an area where interventions have not been effective. The Southern Africa ICEMR will capitalize on the opportunity to investigate the complexities of malaria transmission while adapting to intervention and establish the evidence-base to guide effective and sustainable malaria intervention strategies. Key approaches to attain this goal for the region will include close collaboration with national malaria control programs and contribution to capacity building at the individual, institutional and national levels. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The intense economic growth experienced by Brazil in recent decades and its consequent explosive motorization process have evidenced an undesirable impact: the increasing and unbroken trend in traffic fatality numbers. In order to contribute to road safety diagnosis on a national level, this study presents a research into two main indicators available in Brazil: mortality rate (represented by fatalities per capita) and fatality rate (represented by two sub-indicators, i.e., fatalities per vehicle and fatalities per vehicle kilometer traveled). These indicators were aggregated into a composite indicator or index through a multiple layer data envelopment analysis (DEA) composite indicator model, which looks for the optimum combination of indicators' weights for each decision-making unit, in this case 27 Brazilian states. The index score represents the road safety performance, based on which a ranking of states can be made. Since such a model has never been applied for road safety evaluation in Brazil, its parameters were calibrated based on the experience of more consolidated European Union research in ranking its member countries using DEA techniques. Secondly, cluster analysis was conducted aiming to provide more realistic performance comparisons and, finally, the sensitivity of the results was measured through a bootstrapping method application. It can be concluded that by combining fatality indicators, defining clusters and applying bootstrapping procedures a trustworthy ranking can be created, which is valuable for nationwide road safety planning.},

So why then do so many audiences leave feeling like they've wasted their time? All too often, presentations don't resonate with the audience and move them to transformative action. Just as the author's first book helped presenters become visual communicators, "Resonate" helps you make a strong connection with your audience and lead them to purposeful action. The author's approach is simple: building a presentation today is a bit like writing a documentary. Using this approach, you'll convey your content with passion, persuasion, and impact. Author has a proven track record, including having created the slides in Al Gore's Oscar-winning "An Inconvenient Truth" Focuses on content development methodologies that are not only fundamental but will move people to action Upends the usual paradigm by making the audience the hero and the presenter the mentor Shows how to use story techniques of conflict and resolution Presentations don't have to be boring ordeals. You can make them fun, exciting, and full of meaning. Leave your audiences energized and ready to take action with "Resonate."},

@article{Abajobir2017c,
abstract = {Background As mortality rates decline, life expectancy increases, and populations age, non-fatal outcomes of diseases and injuries are becoming a larger component of the global burden of disease. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of prevalence, incidence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 328 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016. Methods We estimated prevalence and incidence for 328 diseases and injuries and 2982 sequelae, their non-fatal consequences. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death rates for each condition. For some causes, we used alternative modelling strategies if incidence or prevalence needed to be derived from other data. YLDs were estimated as the product of prevalence and a disability weight for all mutually exclusive sequelae, corrected for comorbidity and aggregated to cause level. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. GBD 2016 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). Findings Globally, low back pain, migraine, age-related and other hearing loss, iron-deficiency anaemia, and major depressive disorder were the five leading causes of YLDs in 2016, contributing 57{\textperiodcentered}6 million (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI] 40{\textperiodcentered}8–75{\textperiodcentered}9 million [7{\textperiodcentered}2{\%}, 6{\textperiodcentered}0–8{\textperiodcentered}3]), 45{\textperiodcentered}1 million (29{\textperiodcentered}0–62{\textperiodcentered}8 million [5{\textperiodcentered}6{\%}, 4{\textperiodcentered}0–7{\textperiodcentered}2]), 36{\textperiodcentered}3 million (25{\textperiodcentered}3–50{\textperiodcentered}9 million [4{\textperiodcentered}5{\%}, 3{\textperiodcentered}8–5{\textperiodcentered}3]), 34{\textperiodcentered}7 million (23{\textperiodcentered}0–49{\textperiodcentered}6 million [4{\textperiodcentered}3{\%}, 3{\textperiodcentered}5–5{\textperiodcentered}2]), and 34{\textperiodcentered}1 million (23{\textperiodcentered}5–46{\textperiodcentered}0 million [4{\textperiodcentered}2{\%}, 3{\textperiodcentered}2–5{\textperiodcentered}3]) of total YLDs, respectively. Age-standardised rates of YLDs for all causes combined decreased between 1990 and 2016 by 2{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} (95{\%} UI 2{\textperiodcentered}3–3{\textperiodcentered}1). Despite mostly stagnant age-standardised rates, the absolute number of YLDs from non-communicable diseases has been growing rapidly across all SDI quintiles, partly because of population growth, but also the ageing of populations. The largest absolute increases in total numbers of YLDs globally were between the ages of 40 and 69 years. Age-standardised YLD rates for all conditions combined were 10{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (95{\%} UI 9{\textperiodcentered}0–11{\textperiodcentered}8) higher in women than in men. Iron-deficiency anaemia, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, major depressive disorder, anxiety, and all musculoskeletal disorders apart from gout were the main conditions contributing to higher YLD rates in women. Men had higher age-standardised rates of substance use disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and all injuries apart from sexual violence. Globally, we noted much less geographical variation in disability than has been documented for premature mortality. In 2016, there was a less than two times difference in age-standardised YLD rates for all causes between the location with the lowest rate (China, 9201 YLDs per 100 000, 95{\%} UI 6862–11943) and highest rate (Yemen, 14 774 YLDs per 100 000, 11 018–19 228). Interpretation The decrease in death rates since 1990 for most causes has not been matched by a similar decline in age-standardised YLD rates. For many large causes, YLD rates have either been stagnant or have increased for some causes, such as diabetes. As populations are ageing, and the prevalence of disabling disease generally increases steeply with age, health systems will face increasing demand for services that are generally costlier than the interventions that have led to declines in mortality in childhood or for the major causes of mortality in adults. Up-to-date information about the trends of disease and how this varies between countries is essential to plan for an adequate health-system response.},

abstract = {Concepts of cause and causal inference are largely self-taught from early learning experiences. A model of causation that describes causes in terms of sufficient causes and their component causes illuminates important principles such as multi-causality, the dependence of the strength of component causes on the prevalence of complementary component causes, and interaction between component causes. Philosophers agree that causal propositions cannot be proved, and find flaws or practical limitations in all philosophies of causal inference. Hence, the role of logic, belief, and observation in evaluating causal propositions is not settled. Causal inference in epidemiology is better viewed as an exercise in measurement of an effect rather than as a criterion-guided process for deciding whether an effect is present or not.},

abstract = {Objective. To examine the relationship between public health system network density and organizational centrality in public health systems and public health governance, community size, and health status in three public health domains. Data Sources/Study Setting. During the fall and the winter of 2007–2008, primary data were collected on the organization and composition of eight rural public health systems. Study Design. Multivariate analysis and network graphical tools are used in a case comparative design to examine public health system network density and organizational centrality in the domains of adolescent health, senior health, and preparedness. Differences associated with public health governance (centralized, decentralized), urbanization (micropolitan, noncore), health status, public health domain, and collaboration area are described. Data Collection/Extraction Methods. Site visit interviews with key informants from local organizations and a web-based survey administered to local stakeholders. Principal Findings. Governance, urbanization, public health domain, and health status are associated with public health system network structures. The centrality of local health departments (LHDs) varies across public health domains and urbanization. Collaboration is greater in assessment, assurance, and advocacy than in seeking funding. Conclusions. If public health system organization is causally related to improved health status, studying individual system components such as LHDs will prove insufficient for studying the impact of public health systems.},

@article{Nunes2016a,
abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to critically review the literature available regarding the Zika virus outbreak in Brazil and its possible association with microcephaly cases. Sources: Experts from Instituto do C??rebro do Rio Grande do Sul performed a critical (nonsystematic) literature review regarding different aspects of the Zika virus outbreak in Brazil, such as transmission, epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, and its possible association with the increase of microcephaly reports. The PubMed search using the key word "Zika virus" in February 2016 yielded 151 articles. The manuscripts were reviewed, as well as all publications/guidelines from the Brazilian Ministry of Health, World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC - United States). Summary of findings: Epidemiological data suggest a temporal association between the increased number of microcephaly notifications in Brazil and outbreak of Zika virus, primarily in the Brazil's Northeast. It has been previously documented that many different viruses might cause congenital acquired microcephaly. Still there is no consensus on the best curve to measure cephalic circumference, specifically in preterm neonates. Conflicting opinions regarding the diagnosis of microcephaly (below 2 or 3 standard deviations) that should be used for the notifications were also found in the literature. Conclusion: The development of diagnostic techniques that confirm a cause-effect association and studies regarding the physiopathology of the central nervous system impairment should be prioritized. It is also necessary to strictly define the criteria for the diagnosis of microcephaly to identify cases that should undergo an etiological investigation.},

According to Methodology of Problematization, the students are led to identify the problems from a certain reality, while according to Problem-Based Learning, the problems are formulated by specialists, so that they involve all the disciplines which compose a certain curriculum. Although these two proposals are different, they provide the students with new opportunities to learn.},

abstract = {Identifying kinase substrates and the specific phosphorylation sites they regulate is an important factor in understanding protein function regulation and signalling pathways. Computational prediction of kinase targets – assigning kinases to putative substrates, and selecting from protein sequence the sites that kinases can phosphorylate – requires the consideration of both the cellular context that kinases operate in, as well as their binding affinity. This consideration enables investigation of how phosphorylation influences a range of biological processes. We report here a novel probabilistic model for classifying kinase-specific phosphorylation sites from sequence across three model organisms: human, mouse and yeast. The model incorporates position-specific amino acid frequencies, and counts of co-occurring amino acids from kinase binding sites. We show how this model can be seamlessly integrated with protein interactions and cell-cycle abundance profiles. When evaluating the prediction accuracy of our method, PhosphoPICK, on an independent hold-out set of kinase-specific phosphorylation sites, it achieved an average specificity of 97{\%}, with 32{\%} sensitivity. We compared PhosphoPICK's ability, through cross-validation, to predict kinase-specific phosphorylation sites with alternative methods, and show that at high levels of specificity PhosphoPICK obtains greater sensitivity for most comparisons made. We investigated the relationship between kinase-specific phosphorylation sites and nuclear localisation signals. We show that kinases PKA, Akt1 and AurB have an over-representation of predicted binding sites at particular positions downstream from predicted nuclear localisation signals, demonstrating an important role for these kinases in regulating the nuclear import of proteins. PhosphoPICK is freely available as a web-service at http://bioinf.scmb.uq.edu.au/phosphopick.},

To illustrate its function through an example focused on the development of a tool for diagnosing pneumonia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a system that automates the creation of diagnostic decision-support applications. It relies on a medical ontology to direct the acquisition of clinic data from a clinical data warehouse and uses an automated analytic system to apply a sequence of machine learning algorithms that create applications for diagnostic screening. We refer to this system as the ontology-driven diagnostic modeling system (ODMS). We tested this system using samples of patient data collected in Salt Lake City emergency rooms and stored in Intermountain Healthcare's enterprise data warehouse.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The system was used in the preliminary development steps of a tool to identify patients with pneumonia in the emergency department. This tool was compared with a manually created diagnostic tool derived from a curated dataset. The manually created tool is currently in clinical use. The automatically created tool had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.920 (95{\%} CI 0.916 to 0.924), compared with 0.944 (95{\%} CI 0.942 to 0.947) for the manually created tool.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: Initial testing of the ODMS demonstrates promising accuracy for the highly automated results and illustrates the route to model improvement.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The use of medical knowledge, embedded in ontologies, to direct the initial development of diagnostic computing systems appears feasible.},

In this paper, we use and extend a recently proposed graph theoretic model, which helps capture the evolving characteristic of such networks, in order to propose and formally analyze least cost journey (the analog of paths in usual graphs) in a class of dynamic networks, where the changes in the topology can be predicted in advance.

abstract = {National syndromic surveillance systems require optimal anomaly detection methods. For method performance comparison, we injected multi-day signals stochastically drawn from lognormal distributions into time series of aggregated daily visit counts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's BioSense syndromic surveillance system. The time series corresponded to three different syndrome groups: rash, upper respiratory infection, and gastrointestinal illness. We included a sample of facilities with data reported every day and with median daily syndromic counts ≥1 over the entire study period. We compared anomaly detection methods of five control chart adaptations, a linear regression model and a Poisson regression model. We assessed sensitivity and timeliness of these methods for detection of multi-day signals. At a daily background alert rate of 1{\%} and 2{\%}, the sensitivities and timeliness ranged from 24 to 77{\%} and 3.3 to 6.1. days, respectively. The overall sensitivity and timeliness increased substantially after stratification by weekday versus weekend and holiday. Adjusting the baseline syndromic count by the total number of facility visits gave consistently improved sensitivity and timeliness without stratification, but it provided better performance when combined with stratification. The daily syndrome/total-visit proportion method did not improve the performance. In general, alerting based on linear regression outperformed control chart based methods. A Poisson regression model obtained the best sensitivity in the series with high-count data.},

@article{Bishai2006,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This paper explores why traffic fatalities increase with GDP per capita in lower income countries and decrease with GDP per capita in wealthy countries. METHODS: Data from 41 countries for the period 1992-1996 were obtained on road transport crashes, injuries, and fatalities as well as numbers of vehicles, kilometers of roadway, oil consumption, population, and GDP. Fixed effects regression was used to control for unobservable heterogeneity among countries. RESULTS: A 10{\%} increase in GDP in a lower income country (GDP/Capita {\textless}1600) is expected to raise the number of crashes by 7.9{\%}, the number of traffic injuries by 4.7{\%}, and the number of deaths by 3.1{\%} through a mechanism that is independent of population size, vehicle counts, oil use, and roadway availability. Increases in GDP in richer countries appear to reduce the number of traffic deaths, but do not reduce the number of crashes or injuries, all else equal. Greater petrol use and alcohol use are related to more traffic fatalities in rich countries, all else equal. CONCLUSION: In lower income countries a rise in traffic-related crashes, injuries, and deaths accompanies economic growth. At a threshold of around 1,500 dollars-8,000 dollars per capita economic growth no longer leads to additional traffic deaths, although crashes and traffic injuries continue to increase with growth. The negative association between GDP and traffic deaths in rich countries may be mediated by lower injury severity and post-injury ambulance transport and medical care.},

abstract = {The aim was to assess the effect of geographical accessibility on the stage of cancer at diagnosis and survival. Records of 117,097 cases of breast, colorectal, lung, ovary and prostate cancer diagnosed in Northern England between 1994 and 2002 were supplemented with estimates of travel times to the patients' general practitioners (GPs) and hospitals attended, together with measures of access to public transport. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used, adjusting for age, sex, whether the first hospital visited was a cancer centre and deprivation of area of residence. Late stage at diagnosis was associated with increasing travel time to GP for breast and colorectal cancers and risk of death was associated with travel time to GP for prostate cancer. Travel times to hospital and other accessibility measures showed no consistent associations with stage at diagnosis or survival, so travel to GP was the only influential factor. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Sensitivity and specificity of using individual tumor markers hardly meet the clinical requirement. This challenge gave rise to many efforts, e.g., combing multiple tumor markers and employing machine learning algorithms. However, results from different studies are often inconsistent, which are partially attributed to the use of different evaluation criteria. Also, the wide use of model-dependent validation leads to high possibility of data overfitting when complex models are used for diagnosis. We propose two model-independent criteria, namely, area under the curve (AUC) and Relief to evaluate the diagnostic values of individual and multiple tumor markers, respectively. For diagnostic decision support, we propose the use of logistic-tree which combines decision tree and logistic regression. Application on a colorectal cancer dataset shows that the proposed evaluation criteria produce results that are consistent with current knowledge. Furthermore, the simple and highly interpretable logistic-tree has diagnostic performance that is competitive with other complex models.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: With a tropical rainforest climate, rapid urbanization, changing demography and ecology, Singapore experiences endemic dengue, with the last large outbreak in 2013 culminating in 22170 cases. In the absence of a vaccine on the market, vector control is the key approach for prevention.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: We sought to forecast the evolution of dengue epidemics in Singapore to provide early warning of outbreaks and to facilitate public health response to moderate an impending outbreak.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We developed a set of statistical models using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) methods to forecast the weekly incidence of dengue notifications over a three-month time horizon. This forecasting tool makes use of a variety of data streams, updatable weekly, including recent case data, meteorological data, vector surveillance data, and population-based national statistics. The forecasting methodology was compared to alternative approaches that have been proposed to model dengue case data (seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average and step-down linear regression) by fielding them on the 2013 dengue epidemic, the largest on record in Singapore.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Operationally useful forecasts were obtained at a three month lag using the LASSO-derived-models. Based on mean average percentage error, the LASSO approach provided more accurate forecasts than the previously-published methods we assessed. We demonstrate its utility in Singapore's dengue control program by providing a forecast of the 2013 outbreak for advance preparation of outbreak response.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Statistical models built using machine learning methods such as LASSO have the potential to markedly improve forecasting techniques for recurrent infectious disease outbreaks such as dengue.},

Through the review process, conducted in 2007, it is evident that health promotion and public health applications of GIS can be generally categorized into four predominant themes: disease surveillance (n = 227), risk analysis (n = 189), health access and planning (n = 138), and community health profiling (n = 115). This review explores how GIS approaches have been used to inform decision making and discusses the extent to which GIS can be applied to address health promotion and public health questions. The contribution of this literature review will be to generate a broader understanding of how GIS-related methodological techniques and tools developed in other disciplines can be meaningfully applied to applications in public health policy, promotion, and practice.},

abstract = {Dengue is an arbovirus that has spread throughout different, especially tropical and subtropical, regions of the world. This disease affects humans through mosquito bites. The occurrence of dengue epidemics has increased alarmingly over the last three decades. To detect a pattern regarding the dispersal process of dengue, this research presents a computational model based on three pillars: complex networks, time-varying graphing (TVG), and time-series synchronisation. To establish the synchronisation networks, the Motif-Synchronisation method with TVG was applied to a time series analysis of georeferenced dengue incidence data from the municipalities of Bahia from 2001 to 2016. After applying the model presented in this work, the dispersal behaviour patterns of these epidemics were found amongst the municipalities within Bahia, when synchronised, in epidemic moments. The results indicate that the incidence of dengue is not directly related to the distance between municipalities; rather, a time relation exists regarding the development of the vector and its capacity to transmit disease. The purpose of this model is to contribute to public disease interventions by providing early information.},

abstract = {Objective: Boosting accuracy in automatically discriminating patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal controls (NC), based on multidimensional classification of longitudinal whole brain atrophy rates and their intermediate counterparts in analyzing magnetic resonance images (MRI). Method: Longitudinal percentage of brain volume changes (PBVC) in two-year follow up and its intermediate counterparts in early 6-month and late 18-month are used as features in supervised and unsupervised classification procedures based on K-mean, fuzzy clustering method (FCM) and support vector machine (SVM). The most relevant features for classification are selected using discriminative analysis (DA) of features and their principal components (PC). Accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated in a group of 30 patients with AD (16 males, 14 females, age. ±. standard-deviation (SD). =. 75. ±. 1.36 years) and 30 normal controls (15 males, 15 females, age. ±. SD. =. 77. ±. 0.88 years) using leave-one-out cross-validation. Results: Results indicate superiority of supervised machine learning techniques over unsupervised ones in diagnosing AD and withal, predominance of RBF kernel over lineal one. Accuracies of 83.3{\%}, 83.3{\%}, 90{\%} and 91.7{\%} are achieved in classification by K-mean, FCM, linear SVM and SVM with radial based function (RBF) respectively. Conclusion: Evidence that SVM classification of longitudinal atrophy rates may results in high accuracy is given. Additionally, it is realized that use of intermediate atrophy rates and their principal components improves diagnostic accuracy.},

abstract = {Traditional public health surveillance systems would benefit from integration with knowledge created by new situation-aware realtime signals from social media, online searches, mobile/sensor networks and citizens' participatory surveillance systems. However, the challenge of threat validation, cross-verification and information integration for risk assessment has so far been largely untackled. In this paper, we propose a new system, medi+board, monitoring epidemic intelligence sources and traditional case-based surveillance to better automate early warning, cross-validation of signals for outbreak detection and visualization of results on an interactive dashboard. This enables public health professionals to see all essential information at a glance. Modular and configurable to any ‘event' defined by public health experts, medi+board scans multiple data sources, detects changing patterns and uses a configurable analysis module for signal detection to identify a threat. These can be validated by an analysis module and correlated with other sources to assess the reliability of the event classified as the reliability coefficient which is a real number between zero and one. Events are reported and visualized on the medi+board dashboard which integrates all information sources and can be navigated by a timescale widget. Simulation with three datasets from the swine flu 2009 pandemic (HPA surveillance, Google news, Twitter) demonstrates the potential of medi+board to automate data processing and visualization to assist public health experts in decision making on control and response measures},

Although population health is widely believed to reflect the living conditions in society, surprisingly few comparative studies systematically assess policy impacts of anti-poverty programs. In this paper we estimate the influence of minimum income benefits on mortality using international data on benefit levels in 18 countries 1990-2009. Included are all major non-contributory benefits that low-income households may receive. Our analyses, based on fixed effects pooled time-series regression, show that minimum income benefits improve mortality, measured in terms of age-standardized death rates and life expectancy. The results on country-level links between minimum income benefits and mortality are remarkably robust in terms of measured confounding effects.},

In looking for “ontology” in a search engine, one can find many different approaches.

In order to take advantage of what ontology theories have to offer, one should understand what they address and where they come from. This paper aims to clarify what means to study ontologies and what connections this subject fosters among different research fields. We begin by revisiting the meaning of the term ontology in its original field, Philosophy, to reach its current use in other research fields. We advocate that ontology is a genuine and relevant subject of research in Information Science. Finally, we conclude by offering our view of the opportunities for interdisciplinary research.},

abstract = {Background: This paper presents the latest international descriptive epidemiological data for invasive breast cancer amongst women, including incidence, survival and mortality, as well as information on mammographic screening programmes. Results: Almost 1.4 million women were diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide in 2008 and approximately 459,000 deaths were recorded. Incidence rates were much higher in more developed countries compared to less developed countries (71.7/100,000 and 29.3/100,000 respectively, adjusted to the World 2000 Standard Population) whereas the corresponding mortality rates were 17.1/100,000 and 11.8/100,000. Five-year relative survival estimates range from 12{\%} in parts of Africa to almost 90{\%} in the United States, Australia and Canada, with the differential linked to a combination of early detection, access to treatment services and cultural barriers. Observed improvements in breast cancer survival in more developed parts of the world over recent decades have been attributed to the introduction of population-based screening using mammography and the systemic use of adjuvant therapies. Conclusion: The future worldwide breast cancer burden will be strongly influenced by large predicted rises in incidence throughout parts of Asia due to an increasingly " westernised" lifestyle. Efforts are underway to reduce the global disparities in survival for women with breast cancer using cost-effective interventions. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Factors associated with cycle safety, including international differences in injury and mortality rates, protective equipment and bicycle training, have been subject to increasing academic interest. Environmental variables associated with cycle safety have also been scrutinised, but few studies have focussed on geographical factors at the local level. This paper addresses this research gap by analysing a geo-referenced dataset of road traffic incidents, taken from the UK's STATS19 dataset (2005–2012). We investigate incidents involving cyclists within West Yorkshire. This is an interesting case study area as it has an historically low cycling rate but very ambitions cycling plans following investment from the Department of Transport. West Yorkshire is found to be an unusually risky area for cyclists, with an estimated 53 deaths and 1372 serious injuries per billion kilometres cycled, based on census commuting statistics. This is roughly double the national average. This riskiness varies spatially and temporally, broadly in line with expectations from the previous literature. An unexpected result was that cycling seems to be disproportionately risky for young people in West Yorkshire compared with young people nationally. The case study raises the issue of potential negative health impacts of promoting cycling amongst vulnerable groups in dangerous areas. We conclude by highlighting opportunities for increasing cycling uptake via measures designed primarily to improve safety. The analysis underlying this research is reproducible, based on code stored at github.com/Robinlovelace/bikeR.},

abstract = {This chapter analyzes the problem of data cleansing and the identification of potential errors in data sets. The differing views of data cleansing are surveyed and reviewed and a brief overview of existing data cleansing tools is given. A general framework of the data cleansing process is presented as well as a set of general methods that can be used to address the problem. The applicable methods include statistical outlier detection, pattern matching, clustering, and Data Mining techniques. The experimental results of applying these methods to a real world data set are also given. Finally, research directions necessary to further address the data cleansing problem are discussed.},

abstract = {Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. There is no cure for glaucoma but detection at its earliest stage and subsequent treatment can aid patients to prevent blindness. Currently, optic disc and retinal imaging facilitates glaucoma detection but this method requires manual post-imaging modifications that are time-consuming and subjective to image assessment by human observers. Therefore, it is necessary to automate this process. In this work, we have first proposed a novel computer aided approach for automatic glaucoma detection based on Regional Image Features Model (RIFM) which can automatically perform classification between normal and glaucoma images on the basis of regional information. Different from all the existing methods, our approach can extract both geometric (e.g. morphometric properties) and non-geometric based properties (e.g. pixel appearance/intensity values, texture) from images and significantly increase the classification performance. Our proposed approach consists of three new major contributions including automatic localisation of optic disc, automatic segmentation of disc, and classification between normal and glaucoma based on geometric and non-geometric properties of different regions of an image. We have compared our method with existing approaches and tested it on both fundus and Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) images. The experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches using either geometric or non-geometric properties. The overall glaucoma classification accuracy for fundus images is 94.4{\%} and accuracy of detection of suspicion of glaucoma in SLO images is 93.9 {\%}.},

More than a million people die each year on the world's roads, and the cost of dealing with the consequences of these road traffic crashes runs to billions of dollars (3). Current trends suggest that by 2030 road traffic deaths will become the fifth leading cause of death unless urgent action is taken (2). Strategies exist that are proven to reduce road traffic injuries and a number of countries have successfully used these strategies to reduce their road traffic deaths. In 2004, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank launched the World report on road traffic injury prevention (4). The World report provides extensive information on leading risk factors for road traffic injuries and evidence on effective interventions, and makes recommendations to countries on how to improve national road safety.

Children and teenagers predominated in the cycle group; 55{\%} of the males were aged 0–15 years compared with 41{\%} of the females. Women were involved in 65{\%} of the pedestrian accidents; 69{\%} were aged 50 years or more. Of the accidents involving women aged over 50 years, 61{\%} occurred in icy or snowy conditions. The police statistics were incomplete and accounted for only 23{\%} of the total number of people reported injured by the health authorities. In some respects, the accident pattern in the present study differed from that in other comparable studies.

Different types of "big data" have emerged and have greatly enriched spatial information sciences and related fields in terms of breadth and granularity. Studies that were difficult to conduct in the past time due to data availability can now be carried out. However, big data brings lots of "big errors" in data quality and data usage, which cannot be used as a substitute for sound research design and solid theories. We indicated and summarized the problems faced by current big data studies with regard to data collection, processing and analysis: inauthentic data collection, information incompleteness and noise of big data, unrepresentativeness, consistency and reliability, and ethical issues. Cases of empirical studies are provided as evidences for each problem. We propose that big data research should closely follow good scientific practice to provide reliable and scientific "stories", as well as explore and develop techniques and methods to mitigate or rectify those 'big-errors' brought by big data.},

The rise of different big data frameworks such as Apache Hadoop and, more recently, Spark, for massive data processing based on the MapReduce paradigm has allowed for the efficient utilisation of data mining methods and machine learning algorithms in different domains. A number of libraries such as Mahout and SparkMLib have been designed to develop new efficient applications based on machine learning algorithms. The combination of big data technologies and traditional machine learning algorithms has generated new and interesting challenges in other areas as social media and social networks. These new challenges are focused mainly on problems such as data processing, data storage, data representation, and how data can be used for pattern mining, analysing user behaviours, and visualizing and tracking data, among others. In this paper, we present a revision of the new methodologies that is designed to allow for efficient data mining and information fusion from social media and of the new applications and frameworks that are currently appearing under the "umbrella" of the social networks, social media and big data paradigms.},

Variables in an ecologic analysis may be aggregate measures, environmental measures, or global measures. The purpose of an ecologic analysis may be to make biologic inferences about effects on individual risks or to make ecologic inferences about effects on group rates. Ecologic study designs may be classified on two dimensions: (a) whether the primary group is measured (exploratory vs analytic study); and (b) whether subjects are grouped by place (multiple-group study), by time (time-trend study), or by place and time (mixed study). Despite several practical advantages of ecologic studies, there are many methodologic problems that severely limit causal inference, including ecologic and cross-level bias, problems of confounder control, within-group misclassification, lack of adequate data, temporal ambiguity, collinearity, and migration across groups.},

Demographic data on area-wide deprivation (the index of multiple deprivation) for each ward was also included. Negative binomial count data models were used to analyze the associations between these factors with traffic fatalities, serious injuries and slight injuries. Results suggest that urbanized areas are associated with fewer casualties (especially fatalities) while areas of higher employment density are associated with more casualties. More deprived areas tend to have higher levels of casualties, though not of motorized casualties (except slight injuries). The effect of road characteristics are less significant but there are some positive associations with the density of "A" and "B" level roads.},

abstract = {Car dependence is in decline in most developed cities, but its cause is still unclear as cities struggle with priorities in urban form and transport infrastructure. This paper draws conclusions from analysis of data in 26 cities over the last 40years of the 20th century. Statistical modelling techniques are applied to urban transport and urban form data, while examining the influence of region, city archetype and individual fixed effects. Structural equation modelling is employed to address causation and understand the direct and indirect effects of selected parameters on per capita vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT). Findings suggest that, while location effects are important, transit service levels and urban density play a significant part in determining urban car use per capita, and causality does flow from these factors towards a city's levels of private vehicle travel as well as the level of the provision of road capacity.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There is a lack of longitudinal studies with adequate sample size and follow-up period which have objectively assessed social outcomes among those with mild or moderate musculoskeletal injury or that are not limited to hospital inpatients. We aimed to address this gap by prospectively assessing the potential predictors of return to pre-injury work and daily activities.

METHODS: Persons with mild/moderate musculoskeletal injuries from a vehicle-related crash were surveyed within the first 3 months after the crash (baseline; n=364), and at 12 (n=284) and 24 months (n=252). Participants self-reported return to work, and whether it was return to full or modified duties at work. Analyses were restricted to 170 participants who reported being in pre-injury paid work and had provided information at either 12 months only or at both 12 and 24 months. Return to usual activities was assessed using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) scale 'Usual Activities' dimension.

RESULTS: Twenty-four months after injury 82{\%} (n=121) had returned to work. After multivariable adjustment, not being admitted to hospital was associated with 44{\%} higher likelihood of returning to work at 24 months. Not having any pre-injury chronic illness was associated with returning to work after 24 months, multivariable-adjusted risk ratio (RR), 1.21 (95{\%} confidence intervals, CI: 1.02-1.45). Each 1-SD increase in Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-12 Mental Component Summary (SF-12 MCS) score at baseline was associated with returning to work at 24 months RR 1.13 (95{\%} CI: 1.02-1.25). Younger age, higher SF-12 physical component summary (PCS), and EQ-5D visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were mutually independent predictors of returning to usual activities 24 months later.

CONCLUSION: A range of bio-psychosocial factors, particularly quality of life measures, independently predicted social outcomes including return to work and return to usual daily activities. These determinants could be measured early in the recovery process and be potentially amenable to intervention.},

abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between traffic fatality risk and per capita income and uses it to forecast traffic fatalities by geographic region. Equations for the road death rate (fatalities/population) and its components--the rate of motorization (vehicles/population) and fatalities per vehicle (F/V)--are estimated using panel data from 1963 to 1999 for 88 countries. The natural logarithm of F/P, V/P, and F/V are expressed as spline (piecewise linear) functions of the logarithm of real per capita GDP (measured in 1985 international prices). Region-specific time trends during the period 1963-1999 are modeled in linear and log-linear form. These models are used to project traffic fatalities and the stock of motor vehicles to 2020. The per capita income at which traffic fatality risk (fatalities/population) begins to decline is 8600 US dollars (1985 international dollars) when separate time trends are used for each geographic region. This turning point is driven by the rate of decline in fatalities/vehicles as income rises since vehicles/population, while increasing with income at a decreasing rate, never declines with economic growth. Projections of future traffic fatalities suggest that the global road death toll will grow by approximately 66{\%} over the next twenty years. This number, however, reflects divergent rates of change in different parts of the world: a decline in fatalities in high-income countries of approximately 28{\%} versus an increase in fatalities of almost 92{\%} in China and 147{\%} in India. The road death rate is projected to rise to approximately 2 per 10,000 persons in developing countries by 2020, while it will fall to less than 1 per 10,000 in high-income countries.},

abstract = {Objective To discover diverse genotype-phenotype associations affiliated with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) via genome-wide association study (GWAS) and phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), more cases (T2DM subjects) and controls (subjects without T2DM) are required to be identified (e.g., via Electronic Health Records (EHR)). However, existing expert based identification algorithms often suffer in a low recall rate and could miss a large number of valuable samples under conservative filtering standards. The goal of this work is to develop a semi-automated framework based on machine learning as a pilot study to liberalize filtering criteria to improve recall rate with a keeping of low false positive rate. Materials and methods We propose a data informed framework for identifying subjects with and without T2DM from EHR via feature engineering and machine learning. We evaluate and contrast the identification performance of widely-used machine learning models within our framework, including k-Nearest-Neighbors, Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression. Our framework was conducted on 300 patient samples (161 cases, 60 controls and 79 unconfirmed subjects), randomly selected from 23,281 diabetes related cohort retrieved from a regional distributed EHR repository ranging from 2012 to 2014. Results We apply top-performing machine learning algorithms on the engineered features. We benchmark and contrast the accuracy, precision, AUC, sensitivity and specificity of classification models against the state-of-the-art expert algorithm for identification of T2DM subjects. Our results indicate that the framework achieved high identification performances (∼0.98 in average AUC), which are much higher than the state-of-the-art algorithm (0.71 in AUC). Discussion Expert algorithm-based identification of T2DM subjects from EHR is often hampered by the high missing rates due to their conservative selection criteria. Our framework leverages machine learning and feature engineering to loosen such selection criteria to achieve a high identification rate of cases and controls. Conclusions Our proposed framework demonstrates a more accurate and efficient approach for identifying subjects with and without T2DM from EHR.},

abstract = {The increasing availability of massive volumes of scientific data requires new synthetic analysis techniques to explore and identify interesting patterns that are otherwise not apparent. For biodiversity studies, a "data-driven" approach is necessary because of the complexity of ecological systems, particularly when viewed at large spatial and temporal scales. Data-intensive science organizes large volumes of data from multiple sources and fields and then analyzes them using techniques tailored to the discovery of complex patterns in high-dimensional data through visualizations, simulations, and various types of model building. Through interpreting and analyzing these models, truly novel and surprising patterns that are "born from the data" can be discovered. These patterns provide valuable insight for concrete hypotheses about the underlying ecological processes that created the observed data. Data-intensive science allows scientists to analyze bigger and more complex systems efficiently, and complements more traditional scientific processes of hypothesis generation and experimental testing to refine our understanding of the natural world. {\textcopyright} 2009 by American Institute of Biological Sciences.},

abstract = {A class of statistical models is proposed for longitudinal network data. The dependent variable is the changing (or evolving) relation network, represented by two or more observations of a directed graph with a fixed set of actors. The network evolution is modeled as the consequence of the actors making new choices, or withdrawing existing choices, on the basis of functions, with fixed and random components, that the actors try to maximize. Individual and dyadic exogenous variables can be used as covariates. The change in the network is modeled as the stochastic result of network effects (reciprocity, transitivity, etc.) and these covariates. The existing network structure is a dynamic constraint for the evolution of the structure itself. The models are continuous-time Markov chain models that can be implemented as simulation models. The model parameters are estimated from observed data. For estimating and testing these models, statistical procedures are proposed that are based on the method of moments. The statistical procedures are implemented using a stochastic approximation algorithm based on computer simulations of the network evolution process.},

abstract = {Abstract: Exploring Risk Communication presents a systematic planning approach to risk communication. Risk communication is seen by many as an important tool for managing technological, environmental, and natural risks. The book's goal is to improve risk communication processes in these areas between private and public risk communication sources and the public. The systematic planning approach focuses on research activities which are considered to be diagnostic tools providing insight into the public's reactions to risks and into the public's cognitive abilities to process risk information. These studies give us the necessary ingredients for an adequate risk communication from the audience side of the risk communication process. Evaluation studies are considered necessary to monitor the effectiveness of the communication. Exploring Risk Communication provides a review of current research in risk communication, focusing on perceived trust and credibility of risk communication sources, and arguments in risk messages, risk comparison, and framing of risk. Special attention is paid to the mass media context of risks and its impact on public perception. Finally, the potential of the new interactive media for risk communication is reviewed. The authors have performed several communication studies in the risk area, working from their social psychological background. This results in a monograph interesting to those working on risk communication issues on an academic level, but the systematic planning approach is also a useful frame of reference for risk communication practitioners, or for those who are just interested in the often complex risk communication issues.

abstract = {Overall 5-year survival and factors associated with death were evaluated in a cohort of 342 women with cervical cancer referred to radiotherapy in the Baixada Fluminense, in Greater Metropolitan Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Overall 5-year survival was 25.3{\%}, reaching 60.8{\%} in women with stage IIA or less. The model adjusted by extended Cox proportional regression showed an increase in mortality risk for patients with stages IIB-IIIB (HR = 1.89; 95{\%}CI: 1.214; 2.957) and IVA-IVB (HR = 5.78; 95{\%}CI: 2.973; 11.265). Cytology in asymptomatic women (HR = 0.58; 95{\%}CI: 0.362; 0.961) and referral for first consultation in an oncology service in the Baixada Fluminense (HR = 0.60; 95{\%}CI: 0.418; 0.875) were the main protective factors identified by the study. Waiting time ({\textgreater} 60 versus ≤ 60 days) was not statistically significant, but a delay of 4 days worsened the outcome. The 60-day limit for initiating radiotherapy should be respected, because delay greater than 64 days showed a significant association between all waiting time cut-off points and 5-year mortality risk.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza surveillance systems provide important and timely information to health service providers on trends in the circulation of influenza virus and other upper respiratory tract infections. Online dissemination of surveillance data is useful for risk communication to health care professionals, the media and the general public. We reviewed national influenza surveillance websites from around the world to describe the main features of surveillance data dissemination.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We searched for national influenza surveillance websites for every country and reviewed the resulting sites where available during the period from November 2008 through February 2009. Literature about influenza surveillance was searched at MEDLINE for relevant hyperlinks to related websites. Non-English websites were translated into English using human translators or Google language tools.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 70 national influenza surveillance websites were identified. The percentage of developing countries with surveillance websites was lower than that of developed countries (22{\%} versus 57{\%} respectively). Most of the websites (74{\%}) were in English or provided an English version. The most common surveillance methods included influenza-like illness consultation rates in primary care settings (89{\%}) and laboratory surveillance (44{\%}). Most websites (70{\%}) provided data within a static report format and 66{\%} of the websites provided data with at least weekly resolution.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Appropriate dissemination of surveillance data is important to maximize the utility of collected data. There may be room for improvement in the style and content of the dissemination of influenza data to health care professionals and the general public.},

abstract = {Effective public health practice relies on the availability of public health data sources and assessment tools to convey information to investigators, practitioners, policy makers, and the general public. Emerging communication technologies on the Internet can deliver all components of the "who, what, when, and where" quartet more quickly than ever with a potentially higher level of quality and assurance, using new analysis and visualization tools. Open-source software provides the opportunity to build low-cost information systems allowing health departments with modest resources access to modern data analysis and visualization tools. In this paper, we integrate open-source technologies and public health data to create a web information system which is accessible to a wide audience through the Internet. Our web application, "EpiVue," was tested using two public health datasets from the Washington State Cancer Registry and Washington State Center for Health Statistics. A third dataset shows the extensibility and scalability of EpiVue in displaying gender-based longevity statistics over a twenty-year interval for 3,143 United States counties. In addition to providing an integrated visualization framework, EpiVue's highly interactive web environment empowers users by allowing them to upload their own geospatial public health data in either comma-separated text files or MS Excel spreadsheet files and visualize the geospatial datasets with Google Maps.},

abstract = {There has been a dramatic increase in the body of evidence demonstrating the benefits that come from health research. In 2014, the funding bodies for higher education in the UK conducted an assessment of research using an approach termed the Research Excellence Framework (REF). As one element of the REF, universities and medical schools in the UK submitted 1,621 case studies claiming to show the impact of their health and other life sciences research conducted over the last 20 years. The recently published results show many case studies were judged positively as providing examples of the wide range and extensive nature of the benefits from such research, including the development of new treatments and screening programmes that resulted in considerable reductions in mortality and morbidity. Analysis of specific case studies yet again illustrates the international dimension of progress in health research; however, as has also long been argued, not all populations fully share the benefits. In recognition of this, in May 2013 the World Health Assembly requested the World Health Organization (WHO) to establish a Global Observatory on Health Research and Development (R{\&}D) as part of a strategic work-plan to promote innovation, build capacity, improve access, and mobilise resources to address diseases that disproportionately affect the world's poorest countries. As editors of Health Research Policy and Systems (HARPS), we are delighted that our journal has been invited to help inform the establishment of the WHO Global Observatory through a Call for Papers covering a range of topics relevant to the Observatory, including topics on which HARPS has published articles over the last few months, such as approaches to assessing research results, measuring expenditure data with a focus on R{\&}D, and landscape analyses of platforms for implementing R{\&}D. Topics related to research capacity building may also be considered. The task of establishing a Global Observatory on Health R{\&}D to achieve the specified objectives will not be easy; nevertheless, this Call for Papers is well timed – it comes just at the point where the evidence of the benefits from health research has been considerably strengthened.},

Data.gov is an online portal that provides open access to datasets generated by US public agencies and countries around the world in a machine-readable format. By discussing the challenges and opportunities faced by Data.gov, we provide several lessons that can inform research and practice. We suggest that providing access to open data in itself does not spur innovation. Specifically, we claim that public agencies need to spend resources to improve the capacities of their organizations to move toward 'open data by default'; develop capacities of community to use data to solve problems; and think critically about the unintended consequences of providing access to public data. We also suggest that public agencies need better metrics to evaluate the success of open-data efforts in achieving its goals.},

Complex systems are made up of heterogeneous elements that interact with one another, have emergent properties that are not explained by understanding the individual elements of the system, persist over time, and adapt to changing circumstances. Public health is starting to use results from systems science studies to shape practice and policy, for example in preparing for global pandemics. However, systems science study designs and analytic methods remain underutilized and are not widely featured in public health curricula or training. In this review we present an argument for the utility of systems science methods in public health, introduce three important systems science methods (system dynamics, network analysis, and agent-based modeling), and provide three case studies in which these methods have been used to answer important public health science questions in the areas of infectious disease, tobacco control, and obesity.},

abstract = {In our first editorial after taking over responsibility for the content of the IJE in 2001, we illustrated some of the suc-cesses and failures of epidemiology, and asked the question whether epidemiology would progress or decay in the 21st century? 1 Embracing new opportunities for aetiological understanding provided by the human genome project was one strand of our strategy for making the IJE relevant – but viewed through the Geoffrey Rose lens that determinants of disease rates in a population and influences on individual susceptibility need not be the same. 2,3 We were concerned that the 'big picture' – health and disease are as much social as biological phenomena – should remain in view. Indeed, the role for genetic discovery seemed to be much more attuned to the discovery of mechanisms of disease and re-sulting pharmacological advances. We questioned methodo-logical developments in modern epidemiology which seemed to lack appetite for engaging with the wider uses of epidemiology proposed by Jerry Morris in the 1940s and 50s. 4–13 A formal evaluation of the impact, positive and negative, of the increased methodological refinement of epi-demiology, requested in our 2001 editorial, has yet to be submitted to IJE. However, in this the final issue of the jour-nal under our editorship, there are major contributions on causal thinking in epidemiology which illuminate what modern epidemiology can and cannot do. In 2001, what did we want to do? Up to that point, papers published in the IJE had very largely consisted of original manuscripts reporting new data. We noted that the most im-portant paper that the journal had published in its lifetime was one of the few that were not of this type: an invited talk at an International Epidemiology Association meeting (with few references), beautifully and economically summarizing Geoffrey Rose's big idea alluded to above, with the catchy title 'Sick individuals and sick populations'. 2 Widespread},

abstract = {Emerging infectious diseases have taken on renewed significance in the public health sector since the 1990s. Worldwide, governments are preparing emergency plans to guide them; their plans acknowledge that communication will be vital in the event of an outbreak. However, much of the emerging infectious disease communication literature deals with one-way transmission of facts to the public by experts. Little attention is paid to how differently various groups conceptualize risk, or to the idea that there is more to communication than the intentional transfer of information. Emerging infectious disease communication is often based in traditional health promotion or emergency/crisis communication literature, where it is assumed that the only 'enemy' is the disease, the right course of action is obvious and the expertise (coming from a public health assumed to be value-free) will not be questioned. Research tends to be limited to exploring barriers to understanding or education, to facilitate better message development. Emerging infectious disease communication research should be broadened to include exploration of implicit assumptions about the nature of the problem at hand (and how to deal with it) as well as the concepts of uncertainty, trust, power, values and biases. Recent risk communication theory, whose focus has historically been on more obviously controversial technological/ environmental situations, should guide such research, as it would highlight important contextual factors in which to embed emerging infectious disease communication. This article reviews existing emerging infectious disease communications literature, discusses risk communications theories that could broaden emerging infectious disease communication research, and suggests next steps in a research agenda.},

Results empirically validate the proposed theoretical framework of this study and provide evidence that BDA capability leads to superior firm performance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: As malaria control efforts intensify, it is critical to monitor trends in disease burden and measure the impact of interventions. A key surveillance indicator is the incidence of malaria. Yet measurement of incidence is challenging. The slide positivity rate (SPR) has been used as a surrogate measure of malaria incidence, but limited data exist on the relationship between SPR and the incidence of malaria. METHODS: A cohort of 690 children aged 1-10 years at enrollment were followed for all their health care needs over a four-year period in Kampala, Uganda. All children with fever underwent laboratory testing, allowing us to measure the incidence of malaria and non-malaria fevers. A formula was derived to estimate relative changes in the incidence of malaria (rDeltaIm) based on changes in the SPR and the assumption that the incidence of non-malaria fevers was consistent over time. Observed and estimated values of rDeltaIm were compared over two, six, and 12 month time intervals after restricting the analysis to children contributing observation time between the ages of 4-10 years to control for aging of the cohort. RESULTS: Over the four-year observation period the incidence of malaria declined significantly from 0.93 episodes per person-year in 2005 to 0.39 episodes per person-year in 2008 (p {\textless} 0.0001) and the incidence of non-malaria fevers declined significantly from 2.31 episodes per person-year in 2005 to 1.31 episodes per person-year in 2008 (p {\textless} 0.0001). Younger age was associated with a significantly greater incidence of malaria and the incidence of malaria was significantly higher during seasonal peaks occurring each January-February and May-June. Changes in SPR produced reasonably accurate estimates of rDeltaIm over all time intervals. The average absolute difference in observed and estimated values of rDeltaIm was lower for six-month intervals (0.13) than it was for two-month (0.21) or 12 month intervals (0.21). CONCLUSION: Changes in SPR provided a useful estimate of changes in the incidence of malaria in a well defined cohort; however, a gradual decline in the incidence of non-malaria fevers introduced some bias in these estimates.},

abstract = {Local forms of spatial analysis focus on exceptions to the general trends represented by more traditional global forms of spatial analysis. There is currently a rapid expansion in the development of such techniques but their history almost exactly parallels that of Geographical Analysis, with the first examples of local analysis appearing in the late 1960s. Indeed, Geographical Analysis has published many of the significant contributions in this field. This paper reviews the development of local forms of spatial analysis and assesses the current situation. Following a discussion on the nature and importance of local analysis, examples are given of local forms of point pattern analysis; local graphical approaches; local measures of spatial dependency; the spatial expansion method; adaptive filtering; multilevel modeling; geographically weighted regression; random coefficients models; autoregressive models; and local forms of spatial interaction models.},

abstract = {The emergence of DDD promises tangible global public health benefits, but these are accompanied by significant ethical challenges. While some of the challenges are inherent to public health practice and are only accentuated by the use of digital tools, others are specific to this approach and largely unprecedented. They span a wide spectrum, ranging from risks to individual rights, such as privacy and concerns about autonomy, to individuals' obligations to contribute to the common good and the demands of transparency and trust. We have grouped these concerns under the headings of context sensitivity, nexus of ethics and methodology, and bootstrapping legitimacy. It is vital that engagement with these challenges comes to be seen as part of the development of DDD itself, not as some extrinsic constraint. We intend this paper to be a contribution to the development of a more comprehensive and concrete ethical framework for DDD, one that will enable DDD to find an ethical pathway to realizing its great potential for public health.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Identification of clinical events (eg, problems, tests, treatments) and associated temporal expressions (eg, dates and times) are key tasks in extracting and managing data from electronic health records. As part of the i2b2 2012 Natural Language Processing for Clinical Data challenge, we developed and evaluated a system to automatically extract temporal expressions and events from clinical narratives. The extracted temporal expressions were additionally normalized by assigning type, value, and modifier. MATERIALS AND METHODS The system combines rule-based and machine learning approaches that rely on morphological, lexical, syntactic, semantic, and domain-specific features. Rule-based components were designed to handle the recognition and normalization of temporal expressions, while conditional random fields models were trained for event and temporal recognition. RESULTS The system achieved micro F scores of 90{\%} for the extraction of temporal expressions and 87{\%} for clinical event extraction. The normalization component for temporal expressions achieved accuracies of 84.73{\%} (expression's type), 70.44{\%} (value), and 82.75{\%} (modifier). DISCUSSION Compared to the initial agreement between human annotators (87-89{\%}), the system provided comparable performance for both event and temporal expression mining. While (lenient) identification of such mentions is achievable, finding the exact boundaries proved challenging. CONCLUSIONS The system provides a state-of-the-art method that can be used to support automated identification of mentions of clinical events and temporal expressions in narratives either to support the manual review process or as a part of a large-scale processing of electronic health databases.},

abstract = {Equine influenza is a highly contagious and widespread viral respiratory disease of horses and other equid species, characterised by fever and a harsh dry cough. In 2007, in the first reported outbreak in Australia, the virus spread through the horse populations of two states within 4 months. Most of the geographic spread occurred within the first 10 days and was associated with the movement of infected horses prior to the implementation of movement controls. This study applies social network analysis to describe spread of equine influenza between horse premises infected in the early outbreak period, identifying spread occurring through a contact network and secondary local spatial spread. Social networks were constructed by combining contact-tracing data on horse movements with a distance matrix between all premises holding horses infected within the first 10 days of the outbreak. These networks were analysed to provide a description of the epidemic, identify premises that were central to disease spread and to estimate the relative proportion of premises infected through infected horse movements and through local spatial spread. We then explored the effect of distance on disease spread by estimating the range of local spread (through direct contact, transmission on fomites and windborne transmission) based on the level of fragmentation in the network and also by directly estimating the shape of the outbreak's spatial transmission kernel. During the first 10 days of this epidemic, 197 horse premises were infected; 70 of these were included in the contact-traced network. Most local spread occurred within 5 km. Local spread was estimated to have occurred up to a distance of 15.3 km - based on the contact-and-proximity network - and at a very low incidence beyond this distance based on the transmission kernel estimate. Of the 70 premises in the contact network, spread to 14 premises (95{\%} CI: 9, 20 premises) was likely to have occurred through local spatial spread from nearby infected premises, suggesting that 28.3{\%} of spread in the early epidemic period was 'network-associated' (95{\%} CI: 25.6, 31.0{\%}). By constructing a 'maximal network' of contact and proximity (based on a distance cut-off of 15.3 km), 44 spatial clusters were described, and the horse movements that initiated infection in these locations were identified. Characteristics of the combined network, incorporating both spatial and underlying contact relationships between infected premises, explained the high rate of spread, the sequence of cluster formation and the widespread dispersal experienced in the early phase of this epidemic. These results can inform outbreak control planning by guiding the imposition of appropriate control zone diameters around infected premises and the targeting of surveillance and interventions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Measuring disease and injury burden in populations requires a composite metric that captures both premature mortality and the prevalence and severity of ill-health. The 1990 Global Burden of Disease study proposed disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to measure disease burden. No comprehensive update of disease burden worldwide incorporating a systematic reassessment of disease and injury-specific epidemiology has been done since the 1990 study. We aimed to calculate disease burden worldwide and for 21 regions for 1990, 2005, and 2010 with methods to enable meaningful comparisons over time.

METHODS: We calculated DALYs as the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). DALYs were calculated for 291 causes, 20 age groups, both sexes, and for 187 countries, and aggregated to regional and global estimates of disease burden for three points in time with strictly comparable definitions and methods. YLLs were calculated from age-sex-country-time-specific estimates of mortality by cause, with death by standardised lost life expectancy at each age. YLDs were calculated as prevalence of 1160 disabling sequelae, by age, sex, and cause, and weighted by new disability weights for each health state. Neither YLLs nor YLDs were age-weighted or discounted. Uncertainty around cause-specific DALYs was calculated incorporating uncertainty in levels of all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, prevalence, and disability weights.

FINDINGS: Global DALYs remained stable from 1990 (2{\textperiodcentered}503 billion) to 2010 (2{\textperiodcentered}490 billion). Crude DALYs per 1000 decreased by 23{\%} (472 per 1000 to 361 per 1000). An important shift has occurred in DALY composition with the contribution of deaths and disability among children (younger than 5 years of age) declining from 41{\%} of global DALYs in 1990 to 25{\%} in 2010. YLLs typically account for about half of disease burden in more developed regions (high-income Asia Pacific, western Europe, high-income North America, and Australasia), rising to over 80{\%} of DALYs in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1990, 47{\%} of DALYs worldwide were from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders, 43{\%} from non-communicable diseases, and 10{\%} from injuries. By 2010, this had shifted to 35{\%}, 54{\%}, and 11{\%}, respectively. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of DALYs worldwide in 2010 (up from fourth rank in 1990, increasing by 29{\%}), followed by lower respiratory infections (top rank in 1990; 44{\%} decline in DALYs), stroke (fifth in 1990; 19{\%} increase), diarrhoeal diseases (second in 1990; 51{\%} decrease), and HIV/AIDS (33rd in 1990; 351{\%} increase). Major depressive disorder increased from 15th to 11th rank (37{\%} increase) and road injury from 12th to 10th rank (34{\%} increase). Substantial heterogeneity exists in rankings of leading causes of disease burden among regions.

INTERPRETATION: Global disease burden has continued to shift away from communicable to non-communicable diseases and from premature death to years lived with disability. In sub-Saharan Africa, however, many communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders remain the dominant causes of disease burden. The rising burden from mental and behavioural disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and diabetes will impose new challenges on health systems. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of understanding local burden of disease and setting goals and targets for the post-2015 agenda taking such patterns into account. Because of improved definitions, methods, and data, these results for 1990 and 2010 supersede all previously published Global Burden of Disease results.

abstract = {BACKGROUND - The fourth most frequent tumor in the world, colorectal cancer is commonly diagnosed at an advanced stage. OBJECTIVE - To analyze factors that interfere in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer in users of the Public Health System treated at an universitary hospital in Curitiba, Paran{\'{a}} State, Brazil. METHODS - Cross-sectional, quantitative and descriptive study with 120 patients treated at the institution between 2012 and 2013. Data collection, carried out by means of medical record appointments and patients' interviews, addressed sociodemographic variables; clinical profile; timespan between symptoms, examination, diagnosis, treatment onset and difficulties encountered. Statistical analyses were performed by means of Stata 8.0. RESULTS - Abdominal pain was the most frequent complaint and rectal bleeding presented the highest chance of advanced colorectal cancer diagnosis. From 52.5{\%} of patients with late diagnosis of colorectal cancer, 81{\%} reported difficulties in the health system. CONCLUSION - Results suggest that late diagnosis is due to symptom absence in the early stage of the disease, patients' lack of perception about the severity of the symptoms, need of better of health teams to search early diagnosis. Educational interventions are deemed necessary to the population and health teams, besides actions prioritizing the access to diagnostic testing for serious illnesses.},

abstract = {Zika virus (ZIKV) is yet another arbovirus that is rapidly emerging on a global scale, on the heels of a chikungunya epidemic in the Americas that began in 2013. A ZIKV epidemic that began in Brazil in 2015 has now spread rapidly to more than 30 countries in the Americas and the Caribbean, infecting more than 2 million inhabitants. This epidemic currently continues unabated. The explosive nature of recent outbreaks and concerning links to Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome and microcephaly are incompletely understood. Also unknown is the relative importance of sexual transmission of ZIKV and asymptomatic ZIKV infections to the overall burden of transmission. The limited understanding of ZIKV presents an enormous challenge for responses to this rapidly emerging threat to human health. This article reviews the existing literature on ZIKV and proposes critical questions for vaccine development and other areas of needed research.},

The changes being observed in the distribution of the burden of diseases and injuries - such as recent increases in the incidence of road traffic injuries - are matters of concern. BRICS may need stronger institutional capacity to address such changes in a timely way. In this paper, we present data on road traffic injuries in BRICS and illustrate the enormous challenge that these countries currently face in reducing the incidence of such injuries. There is an urgent need to improve road safety indicators in every country constituting BRICS. It is imperative for BRICS to invest in system-wide road safety interventions and reduce the mortality and morbidity from road traffic injuries.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAbstract available from the publisher.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAbstract available from the publisher.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAbstract available from the publisher.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAbstract available from the publisher.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAbstract available from the publisher.},

It is shown to outperform all other known community detection methods in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks.},

abstract = {The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) and related approaches to human-environment problems (e.g., Forest Transition Theory) generally posit an inverted U-shaped relationship between environmental degradation and economic development, frequently utilizing a cross-national approach. After numerous years of research, the overall empirical evidence remains equivocal: case studies that appear to support key EKC hypotheses are contradicted by others that fail to demonstrate environmental recovery following increasing indices of economic development. This paper undertakes a critical review of EKC approaches, identifying their collective contributions and remaining gaps, and integrating insights from two case study regions in Mexico and Brazil relevant to a forest transition. The larger aim is to identify the arenas that hold the greatest promise for a re-conceptualization of EKC-related approaches to move from proximate understandings of environmental degradation/recovery patterns, to deeper explanations of the processes and institutions structuring those patterns across spatio-temporal scales. We argue that such a reworking is critical to comparative scientific analyses of dynamic and coupled human-environment systems, and for policy prescriptions targeting applied geographical issues and a transition towards sustainability at a variety of scales.},

abstract = {Few studies have been able to measure the evolution of segregation on health disparities or assess whether those disparities existed in rural communities prior to the Great Migration of African Americans to urban centers. We use a newly developed measure of historical racial residential segregation based on individual-level data. The measure exploits complete census manuscript files to identify the races of next-door neighbors. This measure is the first and only measure of historical segregation for rural communities, allowing us to greatly extend the empirical analysis of the effects of racial segregation on health over space and time. Using this comprehensive measure of racial residential segregation, we estimate the historical relationship between racial segregation and mortality. We find that conditional on racial composition, racially segregated environments had higher mortality rates and it was not always the case that the outcomes for blacks were worse than those of whites. These effects of segregation on health differed between urban and rural locations. We conclude by noting how comprehensive measures of segregation can extend the analysis of structural factors in racial health disparities to rural residents and to the historical evolution of health disparities.},

Although the evidence base on which these estimates are made remains somewhat precarious in view of the limited data systems in most low-income and middle-income countries (as per the classification on the World Bank website), these projections highlight the essential need to address road-traffic injuries as a public-health priority. Most well-evaluated effective interventions do not directly focus on efforts to protect vulnerable road users, such as motorcyclists and pedestrians. Yet, these groups comprise the majority of road-traffic victims in low-income and middle-income countries, and consequently, the majority of the road-traffic victims globally. Appropriately responding to these disparities in available evidence and prevention efforts is necessary if we are to comprehensively address this global-health dilemma.},

The EKC proposes that indicators of environmental degradation first rise, and then fall with increasing income per capita. Recent evidence shows however, that developing countries are addressing environmental issues, sometimes adopting developed country standards with a short time lag and sometimes performing better than some wealthy countries, and that the EKC results have a very flimsy statistical foundation. A new generation of decomposition and efficient frontier models can help disentangle the true relations between development and the environment and may lead to the demise of the classic EKC.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nNational Research for Health Systems (NRfHS) in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) have shown growth and consolidation in the last few years. A structured, organized system will facilitate the development and implementation of strategies for research for health to grow and contribute towards people's health and equity.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nMETHODS:$\backslash$r$\backslash$nWe conducted a survey with the health managers from LAC countries that form part of the Ibero-American Ministerial Network for Health Education and Research.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nRESULTS:$\backslash$r$\backslash$nFrom 13 of 18 questionnaires delivered, we obtained information on the NRfHS governance and management structures, the legal and political framework, the research priorities, existing financing schemes, and the main institutional actors. Data on investment in science and technology, scientific production, and on the socio-economic reality of countries were obtained through desk review focused on regional/global data sources to increase comparability.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS:$\backslash$r$\backslash$nBy comparing the data gathered with a review carried out in 2008, we were able to document the advances in research for health system development in the region, mostly in setting governance, coordination, policies, and regulations, key for better functionality of research for health systems. However, in spite of these advances, growth and consolidation of research for health systems in the region is still uneven.},
